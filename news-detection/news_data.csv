The Mirpur-10 metro rail station is likely to resume operations by mid-October, around three months after it was vandalised and subsequently closed in July, officials said.
The authorities are going to carry out a test about the preparedness of the station within this week, they said.
Most of the damaged equipment have already been replaced with equipment from two other relatively less-used stations and from the metro rail training institute.
""We have a plan to reopen Mirpur-10 station by mid-October. We are trying to reopen the station as soon as possible,"" Mohammad Abdur Rouf, managing director of Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd, told The Daily Star today.
He said they will test the preparedness of the station soon and inform the adviser of the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges about the outcome to take a final decision about resumption of the station.
Unidentified individuals went on a rampage at Mirpur-10 and Kazipara metro stations on July 19, amid the student movement for quota reform, which later turned into a people's uprising toppling the Sheikh Hasina led government. Metro rail operations remained suspended for over a month afterwards.
The then Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader had said that reopening the metro stations would not be possible even in one year.
Although metro rail operations resumed on August 25, the two stations remained closed. The authority reopened Kazipara station on September 20.
A DMTCL official said they have brought some equipment from Bijoy Sarani and Uttara South stations to replace the damaged equipment.
Some of the equipment was also brought from the training institute of DMTCL, he said, wishing anonymity.
Two DMTCL officials said the road transport and bridges adviser directed them to reopen the stations as soon as possible.
All the equipment that was damaged was imported from abroad and replacing them with new units from abroad once again would be a long and time-consuming process.
So, they replaced the damaged equipment with those from relatively less-used stations, they said.
They used local glasses to repair the office windows in the station instead of imported glasses to save time, they added.
The authority will later take decisions over whether they will procure new equipment from abroad to be reinstalled in the less-used stations, they said.
The first metro rail line from Uttara to Kamalapur, formally known as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line-6, is being implemented under a Tk 33,472-crore project.
The Uttara-Agargaon section was open to public in December 2022 and the Agargaon-Motijheel section opened in November last year.
Construction of the Motijheel-Kamalapur section is going on and is supposed to start operation by June next year.
Currently more than 3 lakh people used the popular service daily, according to DMTCL.

From vending machines to ticket counters, from offices to police control rooms, from computers to television screens and close circuit cameras -- everything inside the Mirpur-10 metro station was smashed to bits.
On Friday evening, miscreants carried out mindless destruction inside the Mirpur-10 and Kazipara stations amid the ongoing unrest.
The scale of destruction was such that it would take at least a year to repair and replace the equipment and structures, authorities said.
The extent of destruction has also put a question mark on the resumption of metro service.
The metro rail authority suspended its operation for indefinite period from yesterday, amid the ongoing unrest. Before the suspension, more than 3 lakh people used the metro services every day.
""There is nothing left... They damaged and looted everything needed for the operations…,"" said MAN Siddique, managing director of Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd, while visiting the Mirpur-10 station yesterday afternoon, along with other DMTCL officials.
While they were visiting the Mirpur-10 station, miscreants attacked the Kazipara station once again, another official said.
Asked when services at the stations can be resumed, MAN Siddique couldn't provide any timeframe.
""The people with technical knowledge, who visited the station [Mirpur-10] with me, said it would take at least a year to make the two stations operational,"" he said.
Asked whether the destruction will affect the resumption of overall metro rail operations, he said, ""It's not possible to comment on the matter now. We will check all the aspects once the situation returns to normal.""
Another official, who visited the Mirpur-10 station, said miscreants broke down the (north-west end) entrance gate. However, when they could not break the shutter on the first floor, they smashed the window glasses to get into the station.
They vandalised ticket counters, vending machines, fire extinguishers, TV screens, CCTV cameras and each and every room on the floor, the official said, wishing anonymity.
They even tried to break open the ticket vending machines to loot money, he said.
""It seems the attackers had a personal grudge against the metro rail…,"" he said.
Replying to a question, he said it would take some time to replace all these equipment and fix the rooms. For example, he said, they have to set up vending machines, which have to be customised as per our usability.
""Besides, all these sophisticated equipment need to be replaced. We also have to carry out trials before starting operations in the stations,"" he said.
Mass Rapid Transit Line-6, the country's first metro rail line, was made partially operational from Uttara to Agargaon in December 2022. The Agargaon-Motijheel section opened for service in October last year.
The government is implementing a Tk 33,472 crore project to build the 21.26km line from Uttara to Kamalapur, with most of the fund coming from Japan as loan.

A curious tale of two cases

Gaza still bleeds
Bangladesh's interim leader has refused to give a timeframe for elections following the ouster of his autocratic predecessor, saying in an interview published Tuesday that reforms are needed before polls.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was appointed the country's ""chief advisor"" after the student-led uprising that toppled ex-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.
The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer is helming a temporary administration, to tackle what he has called the ""extremely tough"" challenge of restoring democratic institutions.
""None of us are aiming at staying for a prolonged time,"" Yunus said of his caretaker government, in an interview published by the Prothom Alo newspaper.
""Reforms are pivotal,"" he added. ""If you say, hold the election, we are ready to hold the election. But it would be wrong to hold the election first.""
Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.
More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to her ouster, according to a preliminary United Nations report which said the figure was likely an underestimate.
Her government was also accused of politicising courts and the civil service, as well as staging lopsided elections, to dismantle democratic checks on its power.
Yunus said he had inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.
""Reforms mean we will not allow a repetition of what happened in the past"", he added.
'Write as you please'
Yunus also batted away criticism at the numerous politicians, senior police officers and other Hasina loyalists arrested on murder charges after her government's ouster.
The arrests have prompted accusations that Yunus' caretaker government would hold politicised trials of senior figures from Hasina's regime.
But Yunus said it was his intention that any criminal trials initiated against those arrested would remain free from government interference.
""Once the judicial system is reformed, then the issues will come forward, about who will be placed on trial, how justice will be carried out,"" he said.
At least 25 journalists -- considered by Hasina's opponents to be partisans of her government -- have been arrested for alleged violence against protesters since her downfall.
Press watchdog Reporters Without Borders has condemned those arrests as ""systematic judicial harassment"".
But Yunus insisted he wanted media freedom.
""Write as you please,"" he told the newspaper.
""Criticise. Unless you write, how will we know what is happening or not happening?""

Speakers at a roundtable today called for the immediate repeal of the Cyber Security Act (CSA), condemning it as a tool used by the ""fascist government"" to suppress free speech and instill fear, much like its predecessor, the Digital Security Act (DSA).
They urged the government to replace the CSA with a new law that genuinely protects citizens' rights online.
The event, titled ""Revocable Cyber Security Act: People's Expectations,"" was held at the Jatiya Press Club and organised by Digitally Right, Nagorik, and the UN Resident Coordinator Office.
Around 30 participants, including victims of the law, rights activists, political leaders, lawyers, journalists, and civil society members, echoed these demands.
They called for the dismissal of all cases filed under the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act 2006, the DSA 2018, and the CSA 2023, alongside adequate compensation for victims.
They also demanded accountability for those responsible for misusing the law, from law enforcement officers to members of the judiciary.
Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), stressed the urgency of repealing the CSA and compensating the victims. He argued that the law has served only to harass citizens and warned that without accountability, such abuses could recur.
Other prominent speakers included photographer Shahidul Alam, Rastra Sangskar Andolon's Hasnat Kaiyum, Barrister Jyotirmoy Barua, and ARTICLE 19's Sheikh Manjur-E-Alam.
Moderated by rights activist Rezaur Rahman Lenin and chaired by Executive Director of Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit CR Abrar, the event featured testimonies from victims who recounted their ordeals and renewed calls for the law's abolition.

https://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/the-great-wave/news/chronicle-the-july-uprising-3721021,No Title,"On August 5, 2024 Bangladesh’s students and mass people achieved what some of the biggest political
                    parties could not accomplish in the last 15 years—unseating an autocratic regime through a popular
                    uprising.
When students’ demand for reforming the quota system in the government job sector was met with
                    unprecedented violence, student leaders of different universities steered the movement in the
                    ultimate direction of ousting Sheikh Hasina’s regime.
These students had to brave continuous threats from the police and intelligence agencies; they had to
                    win vicious street battles with trigger happy law enforcement agencies and Awami League cadres when
                    the protesters were only armed with sticks and pebbles; and they had to take an uncompromising
                    stance defying all odds.
When students took to the streets on July 1, 2024, demanding reforms of the quota system, they did
                    not imagine that this movement was about to rewrite the history of Bangladesh.
Ganatantrik Chhatra Shakti (GCS), a students’ platform that came into being in 2023, started to
                    organise peaceful demonstrations all over the country, protesting reinstatement of the quota system
                    by the High Court on June 5.
Akram Hossain, a GCS leader and now a member of the Nagorik Committee, said, “Initially, we did not think
                    that the protest for quota reform could turn into an anti-government movement. We did not have any
                    intention to topple the government; we wanted to settle the issue peacefully by staging protests
                    within university campuses.”

Then, on July 14, students at different dormitories of Dhaka University burst into anger when, at a
                    press conference, the then prime minister Sheikh Hasina compared the student protesters to children
                    and grandchildren of Razakars, a militia force manned by Bangalees who collaborated with the Pakistan
                    army and fought against the freedom fighters during the Liberation War of 1971.
That night, agitated students took to the streets chanting the slogan “Who are you? Who am I?
                    Razakar, Razakar.”
AB Zubair, a student leader of DU, who was one of the first persons to chant this slogan, said,
                    “Through these slogans, we wanted to assert that we did not care about Hasina’s branding of anyone
                    who did not submit to her command or who demanded justice in society as Razakar or anti-liberation
                    force.” According to Zubair and several other leaders, the two lines, “Says who? Says who? The
                    dictator, the dictator!”, were added later to the original slogan to avoid any misunderstanding.
Mito Akter, a student of DU’s Bangladesh-Kuwait Maitree Hall, recounted, “The press conference
                    enraged me. As I was having dinner, I heard ‘Razakar, Razakar’ slogans from the massive processions
                    going past my dormitory. I stopped eating and chanted the slogans from my balcony.”
“At first I was alone, but within minutes, hundreds of female students of my dormitory joined me.
                        Many of us joined the procession too. I still feel goosebumps when I remember that night. I think
                        that was the beginning of the end for Hasina,” added Mito.

The slogans and processions in defiance of Sheikh Hasina’s comment caused uproar among Bangladesh
                    Chhatra League (BCL) leaders, who initially did not intervene with this year’s quota reform
                    movement. They started to organise their activists against the protesting students, chanting slogans
                    “Who are you? Who are you? Bangalee, Bangalee!” News broke out on social media that BCL activists
                    had begun to confront and block students in the DU dorms from attending the larger processions.
Thanks to the circulating videos, students of Jahangirnagar University (JU) and Chittagong University
                    (CU) also took to the streets.
Hasib Zaman, JU student and assistant general secretary of the JU chapter of Bangladesh Chhatra Union
                    (BCU) said, “When we brought out processions protesting Sheikh Hasina’s remarks, we were soon
                    confronted by BCL cadres. But they faced fierce resistance from the protesting students, and we can
                    proudly say that JU was the first university to be declared free of BCL activists.”
According to him, the BCL activists launched violent attacks on the protesting students when they
                    went to the vice chancellor’s bungalow to clarify their demands. In face of attacks, the protesters
                    soon regrouped, resisted and finally evicted all the BCL cadres from the campus on July 15.
Students of CU also brought out massive processions. Mohammad Ali, a student leader of CU, said, “The
                    slogan became massively popular among all students. Such a large number of students joined our
                    procession that BCL activists did not dare resist us that night.”
In response to students’ defiance, Obaidul Quader, the then general secretary of Awami League,
                    commented at a party meeting that BCL is enough to subdue the unruly students.
On July 15, BCL launched a vicious assault with rods, bamboo sticks and clubs on female student protesters at DU.Photo:Prabir Das
DU student Sanzida Afifa, one of the victims of that attack, recounted, “Around 500 armed BCL cadres
                    rushed towards a peaceful protest organised by the female students of DU. They specifically targeted
                    us and flogged us while shouting that we were Razakars and Pakistani agents.”
Mito Akter was also severely beaten. “I saw a sister faint but those thugs still beat her fallen
                    body. I was also badly hurt, but somehow managed to limp to the Nilkhet Residential Area gate where
                    some guards quickly took me inside. There I lost consciousness and after some primary treatment, I
                    recovered.”
Students of all the public universities took to the streets again, protesting the vicious attack
                    against the female students of DU.
Students of CU got involved in a violent clash with BCL activists when they staged a protest at
                    Sholashohor Railway Station, which students use to reach the city from their university.
On July 16, the murder of Abu Sayed, a student of Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur, turned the tide
                    of the movement.
Abdul Kader, a student leader of DU, recounted, “Videos showing how Abu Sayed was shot in cold blood
                    sparked wildfire among student protesters. Abu Sayed’s courage against the armed police and his
                    ultimate sacrifice inspired many people to join our movement who, perhaps, were never bothered about
                    quota reform. He was the first martyr of the July uprising.”
On July 17, students of DU offered funeral prayers in absentia at Shaheed Minar and VC Chattar, which
                    was attacked by police and BCL. Police threw numerous sound grenades at the students.

Shadik Kayem, one of the student leaders of DU who later emerged as the president of DU chapter of
                    Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir, said, “After vicious attacks on female students, we demanded
                    protection from the university administration but they failed. Furthermore, they told us to evacuate
                    the dorms to disperse the students.”
“After the funeral prayer, we were determined not to leave the dormitories and demanded justice for
                    the murder of Abu Sayed and attack on students. The government again responded with violence. They
                    threw tear shells and sound grenades at us. Hundreds of students were badly injured that day,” said
                    Kayem.
However, these attacks only forged unity among students and strengthened their resolve. The attack on
                    female students, Abu Sayed’s murder and further attack on the funeral prayer on July 17 encouraged
                    students of private universities to join the protest.
Although large scale protests were being organised all over the country, the overwhelming presence of
                            police, BGB, Rab and AL activists pushed the students of DU to their limits. Many students decided
                            to leave their dorms, and the movement in Dhaka began to lose its momentum. At that point, students
                            of DU mobilised private university students, who were also outraged by the violence, to join the
                            movement.
When the call was made to join the protest, thousands of students from different private universities
                            took to the streets, and many of them marched towards DU to show their support.

Afia Jannat Ananna, a student of Brac University, said, “As preparation, we studied the quota reform
                    movement, and the legal provisions on quota in government service and the recent high court verdict,
                    because we assumed we would be questioned.”
On July 18, when the students of Brac University along with other private universities in Dhaka took
                    to the streets, the police, in fact, enquired about their stake in quota reforms and told them to
                    return to campus.
“However, when we answered all of their questions and did not move from the street adjacent to our
                    campus, they verbally and physically assaulted us. We quickly went into the ground floor of the
                    university building, but the police threw tear shells and sound grenades inside, injuring many of
                    us,” said Ananna.
Students of several private universities staged massive demonstrations in Banasree, Aftabnagar and
                    Rampura areas. They painted streets and walls with anti-government slogans and blocked all the major
                    intersections to resist the government forces.
“Police and AL cadres fired live rounds at us from point blank range and also from very far away. I
                    saw two protesters get shot in their abdomen and die. I was quite sure that they were killed by
                    sniper shots,” said Arman Sadique, a student leader of East West University.
Private university students put up a strong resistance in Uttara and Mirpur too. Nayeem Abedin, a
                    student of East West and an organiser of the students of private universities, said, “Many students
                    who could not come to the campus staged protests in their own neighbourhoods. In this way, protests
                    spread all over the city.”

According to Nayeem, private university students played a major role in controlling Dhaka’s major
                    streets. When the central coordinators were announcing blockade and shutdown programmes, these
                    students, many of whom live in residential and commercial areas near the universities, used to block
                    their neighbourhood and nearby major streets such as Airport Road, Gulshan, and intersections of
                    Uttara and Mirpur.
“We were determined to maintain control over the major streets so that police or BGB could not cross
                    a street to attack another group of protesters occupying another intersection or street. In this
                    way, we kept different groups of police and BGB isolated from each other and prevented them from
                    cornering us. Still, too many lives were lost due to mindless, indiscriminate firing,” added Nayeem.
Such contributions from the students of private universities proved to be a lifeline for the
                    protesters in Dhaka. As DU leader Abdul Kader said, “On July 17, when DU authorities ordered all
                    students to leave the dorms and closed the university for an indefinite period, we faced a major
                    crisis. Many students started to leave Dhaka and we thought that our movement would be finished now.
                    But when private university students joined, our movement got a new lease of life. Many students who
                    decided to leave Dhaka threw away their bus tickets and stayed to continue the protest.”
Students were deeply frustrated by the lack of media coverage of the protests. Many outlets failed to
                    even report on upcoming events announced by student coordinators.
As Abdul Kader explained, “We consistently sent press releases to all TV channels and newspapers.
                    Most ignored our news. The media painted a picture of a country unaffected by protests, but in
                    reality, countless protesters were arrested, abducted, or killed daily.”
Denied by mainstream media, students resorted to social media to spread their message and maintain
                    the movement’s organisation nationwide. Brac student Ananna played a pivotal role in the social
                    media campaign.
“Pro-government groups exploited social media to spread rumours and distract people from the
                    movement,” Ananna said. “They created thousands of fake accounts, spreading misinformation and
                    disinformation to damage the student movement’s image. We worked tirelessly to identify and expose
                    these tactics to prevent confusion.”

Social media served as the movement’s cultural centre. Students wrote and performed protest songs
                    that quickly went viral. Mito Akter shared, “When unable to participate in outdoor events, we sang
                    protest songs and shared them on social media platforms. Many of these songs inspired protesters.”
Students also used social media to educate themselves about the movement and its cause. Munwara Itu
                    noted, “As private university students, we lacked awareness of legal provisions for quota reforms
                    and Bangladesh’s history. We researched these topics and shared content related to the movement and
                    Bangladesh’s history on social media. Content explaining the discriminatory nature of the previous
                    quota system and the role of the ruling party over the past 15 years went viral. We also shared
                    photos and videos of the movement.”
Hasib Zaman, a student leader from JU, emphasised social media’s role in making the movement
                    inclusive and organised. He said, “We held online meetings with student leaders and coordinators
                    nationwide. Student leaders also met with leaders from different political parties to garner their
                    support.”
Regarding campaigns, Abdul Kader explained, “In late July, the government encouraged supporters to
                    use black profile pictures to commemorate August as the month of mourning. Despite numerous martyred
                    protesters, the government ignored our demands. We countered by announcing a red profile picture
                    campaign, symbolising protest, power, bloodshed, and defiance.”
The social media landscape of Bangladesh turned red, demonstrating overwhelming public support for
                    the students’ cause.
Unable to quell the protests, Hasina expressed interest in negotiating with the students.
                    High-ranking AL political leaders and intelligence officials began contacting student leaders,
                    applying significant pressure to engage in discussions. On July 26 and 27, the Detective Branch (DB)
                    of police detained six movement coordinators. On July 28, the police forced these coordinators to
                    record video statements urging student protesters to postpone all scheduled programmes.
This move by DB further incensed students and the general public. All other coordinators immediately
                    took to the streets, denouncing the video statements.

The next day, on July 29, Abdul Kader, accompanied by several other student leaders, read out the
                    nine-point demand of the movement, marking a decisive moment in the July uprising.
“Despite immense government pressure to negotiate and assurances of abolishing the quota system, we
                    remained determined to continue our movement until we achieved justice for our martyred, injured,
                    and detained comrades,” Abdul Kader said.Shadik Kayem stated, “By then, it was clear that the students’ and people’s protest against Hasina’s
                    rule was no longer about quota reforms. Hasina and her administration must be held accountable for
                    murder, violence, and mass arrest of innocent people.”With the nine-point demand, students made it clear that abduction or forcing students to issue video
                    statements would not deter them. Continuous pressure from students and civil society, led to all six
                    coordinators being released on August 1.According to Abdul Kader, “We declared the nine-point demand under incredible government pressure and
                    threats. Our lives were at stake. Meanwhile, students and protesters were urging us to announce a
                    one-point demand: the resignation of Hasina and her government. We realised that without Hasina’s
                    resignation, peace and normalcy would never be restored.”On August 3, hundreds of thousands of students and the general public joined the “Droho Jatra”,
                    convened by public intellectual Anu Muhammad and organised by university teachers and students,
                    demanding Hasina’s resignation. Later, in the afternoon, the coordinators declared the one-point
                    demand at Shaheed Minar.The student leaders also called for an all-out non-cooperation movement unless their one-point demand
                    was met.The final battlesThe declaration of the nine-point movement and ultimately the one-point movement sparked massive
                    protests all over the country. Besides Dhaka, every major city and town turned into a battlefield
                    between students alongside common people and government forces.
                    Defying curfew, protesters gathered in thousands at city centres, parks, major streets and other
                    public places demanding Hasina’s resignation and enforcing the blockades and non-cooperation
                    movement.While police, BGB and AL frequently opened fire at protesters, killing them in hundreds, protesters
                    also resisted and drove them away. Some of the most vicious fighting took place in Jatrabari where
                    protesters sacrificed their lives to take control of the Dhaka-Chattrogram highway.The police and Awami League cadres fired live rounds at the protesters.Photo:Rajib RaihanPolice and security forces were deployed with lethal weapons. They gunned down protesters from
                    armoured vehicles and helicopters. Drones flew over and identified exact locations. However, all
                    these weapons and technologies failed in face of sheer courage and determination of the protesters
                    who were armed only with sticks, bamboos and brick chips.Md Burhan Uddin Noman, a lecturer of Daffodil International University, said, “I have seen many dead
                    bodies piled up on one another in the streets of Jatrabari. Police only stopped shooting at the
                    protesters when they ran out of ammunition.”“But still we did not leave the street. We knew that police would hunt us down from our homes if we
                    left. So it was better to die fighting,” added Noman.Students from JU and other nearby institutions, with the help of workers from Savar and Ashulia,
                    blocked Dhaka-Aricha highway. Roadblocks were placed in all major intersections, cutting off Dhaka
                    from most of the northern and southern parts of Bangladesh.Officers from Savar and Ashulia police stations made several attempts to dislodge the protesters
                    using lethal and non-lethal weapons, killing many of them.Hasib Zaman shared, “In the final days of the movement, we found the army on our side. They did not
                    confront us. Their silent support significantly helped us continue.”In Chattogram, the students staged some of the biggest gatherings the city has ever seen in Lal
                    Dighir Maidan. However, vicious street fighting broke out with AL activists when the students
                    reached Sholashohor station. Students in Bahaddarhat were also resisted by AL.Mohammad Ali said, “BCL cadres... fired at the protesters. The police also fired live rounds at the
                    protesters killing more than 20 of them in the last four days of the movement. On July 4, the
                    Sholashohor railway station switched hands between the protesters and BAL cadres no less than three
                    times.”On August 4, a decisive battle was fought at Shahbagh after which BCL went out of action once and for
                    all.The previous day, BCL threatened that a joint attack by BCL and Jubo League would wipe out the
                    protesters from Dhaka within a few minutes. On August 4, students from different parts of the city
                    gathered at Shahbagh to face the imminent, final assault.Musaddiq Ali Ibne Mohammad and AB Jubair, two students of DU, organised the resistance that day.
                    Jubair narrated, “I took around 500 students with me and took position at Shahbagh as we got news
                    that BCL activists may try to enter the campus from there. However, when we reached Shahbagh we did
                    not see any presence of AL.”“Then I learned that some key BCL leaders had taken shelter at BSMMU and a nearby residential hotel.
                    So we surrounded the area. Seeing our manpower, the leaders quickly fled from the hospital, but they
                    set many vehicles on fire to paint us as terrorists. But the fact is our students never entered
                    BSMMU’s premises,” added Mosaddique.According to student coordinators, BCL set vehicles on fire inside BSMMU to paint the protesters as terrorists.Photo:Star.Brutal street fighting between protesters and government forces broke out all over the country.
                    Students, factory workers, rickshaw pullers, street children and people from all walks of life also
                    put up a strong resistance in Ashulia, Uttara, in different parts of Chattogram, Sylhet, Rajshahi,
                    Bogra, Thakurgaon, Rangpur and elsewhere.“Participation of working class people such as rickshaw pullers, transport workers, and factory
                    workers were a major source of strength for us. One street food seller distributed all of his food
                    free of cost for the protesters. Many rickshaw pullers spent their entire day’s income to buy food
                    and water for us,” said Akram. “Many of these people who sacrificed their lives for us might be
                    lying unidentified in some unmarked grave. We must remember these unsung heroes and their stories
                    must be written.”Students united for one demandDuring the July Uprising, students from different political ideologies formed a common alliance under
                    the platform “Students Against Discrimination.”Students from Chhatra Dal, Chhatra Shibir, Chhatra Shakti, Chhatra Union, Chhatra Federation and
                    other different groups and non-political, apolitical students voluntarily worked with each other,
                    leaving behind their differences, to fight against the autocratic regime.Akram, one of the key organisers of the movement, said, “We knew the political orientation of the
                    major figures of this movement. When Hasina’s government started killing people, we realised that
                    this movement was going to be a prolonged campaign. So we asked all the students to leave behind
                    their political differences and remain united to defeat fascism”.On August 5, Sheikh Hasina hastily fled to India leaving behind a legacy of corruption, murder, injustice and a country on the verge of economic collapse.Photo:Star.Hasib, the leader of a left-wing student group Chhatra Union said, “Different student groups that
                    were affiliated with political parties maintained their connection with their political leaders. But
                    till August 5, they never tried to push their political agenda. This is how we could stay united and
                    I believe if there is any attempt to restore fascism, we shall be able to resist again.”Such a sense of collaboration between right-wing student groups like Shibir and left-wing groups is
                    unprecedented in the recent history of Bangladesh. How did such collaboration work?When asked this question, Shadik Kayem said, “We wanted to establish a democratic Bangladesh where
                    people will be able to live with freedom and dignity... We generated ideas together and helped each
                    other organise the movement and motivate the students. I don’t say he or she is the mastermind of
                    the movement. I say that all the students and mass people who helped us and participated are the
                    heroes.”Fall of HasinaOn August 4, when students announced the march to Dhaka programme, at least a million people started
                    their march from different locations. The coordinators disseminated messages to all the districts,
                    instructing people to use different and specific routes to enter Dhaka to avoid bottlenecks and to
                    overwhelm the security forces by rushing in from all sides.Thanks to their strategic planning, by morning hundreds of thousands of people were already marching
                    towards Gono Bhaban, Hasina’s official residence. She hastily fled to India leaving behind a legacy
                    of corruption, murder, injustice and a country on the verge of economic collapse.Nayeem Abedin shared, “We did not think that Hasina would flee. We were actually planning to keep her
                    residence under siege for some time. However, we were overjoyed to know that she was finally gone.”In fact, the students were already worried about their next course of action. According to Abdul
                    Kader, “As we were preparing for a prolonged siege, we did not have the time to think about the
                    post-Hasina government. We were really lucky that Dr Yunus accepted our request and took charge
                    immediately.”Concerns still remainAlmost two months after the fall of Hasina, most of the students did not get a chance to celebrate.
                    Tackling several attempts to destabilise the country, helping the newly-formed government to restore
                    the administration and reaching out to the flood victims, they have been constantly in the field to
                    respond to any crisis that may endanger the interim government.Students who took part in the movement from different political affiliations are now resurfacing in
                    the political scene and claiming their stake in the post-Hasina government. As a result, tensions
                    between different student groups are forming. This has raised a new concern among the students: will
                    Bangladesh return to violent political infighting again?Abdul Kader said, “Different student groups may have varying political ideologies but they must not
                    impose their ideologies on others. Clashes between student groups occur when they start the politics
                    of occupying campuses like they did during the previous regimes. If they try to do so, they are
                    propagating fascism and we shall resist them like we resisted AL.”Mito Akhter opined, “We are afraid that if the conflict between student groups continues to rise,
                    political parties may grab this opportunity to create division among students and exploit them for
                    their own political interest. This is why we proposed that partisan student politics should be
                    banned from universities and central student union-centric politics should be encouraged in the
                    university.”Besides political feuds, students are also concerned about visible discrimination among students
                    belonging to different institutions. There is a sense of deprivation among the students of private
                    universities, madrasas and other institutions who played a major role in the movement but have been
                    “forgotten” after the goal was achieved.Brac’s Afia Jannat Ananna said, “It is really unfortunate that after forming the government, students
                    of private universities have completely been brushed aside. Our role has been forgotten. Many
                    important steps have already been taken by the interim government, but we did not have any chance to
                    share our thoughts and opinions on those matters.”Students are also concerned about preserving the history and essence of the July Uprising. Attempts
                    of disowning the slogans, erasing graffitis and forgetting the protest songs have created concerns.AB Jubair said, “On September 14, two months after the day when we made the historic ‘Razakar’
                    slogan, some student leaders tried to denounce it on social media. I agree that the slogan is heavy
                    with context. But, we should preserve history so that the next generation can learn about the
                    context; we should not denounce it.”Students are also dissatisfied about the fact that the government made no effort to preserve the
                    graffiti and songs that were made during the days of protests. In some places, the graffiti was
                    erased to make way for aesthetic paintings, new slogans or calligraphies.Students are also concerned over many unmet demands that they raised during the protest.“Various demands that we mentioned in the historic nine-point movement have not been implemented,”
                    explains Akram. “Many of those demands are still unfulfilled. Many perpetrators of the massacre are
                    still serving in the administration, and many key political leaders who ordered the massacre are
                    still free. We feel that the administration is not cooperating in this regard, and it is a matter of
                    great concern for us. This is why we have formed the Nagorik Committee so that we can act as a
                    pressure group for the government. I think more pressure groups like these should be formed by the
                    students and conscious people to guide the government.”Md Shahnawaz Khan Chandanis an Assistant Professor at Institute of Education and Research,

Shadik Kayem stated, “By then, it was clear that the students’ and people’s protest against Hasina’s
                    rule was no longer about quota reforms. Hasina and her administration must be held accountable for
                    murder, violence, and mass arrest of innocent people.”With the nine-point demand, students made it clear that abduction or forcing students to issue video
                    statements would not deter them. Continuous pressure from students and civil society, led to all six
                    coordinators being released on August 1.According to Abdul Kader, “We declared the nine-point demand under incredible government pressure and
                    threats. Our lives were at stake. Meanwhile, students and protesters were urging us to announce a
                    one-point demand: the resignation of Hasina and her government. We realised that without Hasina’s
                    resignation, peace and normalcy would never be restored.”On August 3, hundreds of thousands of students and the general public joined the “Droho Jatra”,

                    demand at Shaheed Minar.The student leaders also called for an all-out non-cooperation movement unless their one-point demand
                    was met.The final battlesThe declaration of the nine-point movement and ultimately the one-point movement sparked massive
                    protests all over the country. Besides Dhaka, every major city and town turned into a battlefield
                    between students alongside common people and government forces.
                    Defying curfew, protesters gathered in thousands at city centres, parks, major streets and other
                    public places demanding Hasina’s resignation and enforcing the blockades and non-cooperation

                    Dighir Maidan. However, vicious street fighting broke out with AL activists when the students
                    reached Sholashohor station. Students in Bahaddarhat were also resisted by AL.Mohammad Ali said, “BCL cadres... fired at the protesters. The police also fired live rounds at the
                    protesters killing more than 20 of them in the last four days of the movement. On July 4, the
                    Sholashohor railway station switched hands between the protesters and BAL cadres no less than three
                    times.”On August 4, a decisive battle was fought at Shahbagh after which BCL went out of action once and for
                    all.The previous day, BCL threatened that a joint attack by BCL and Jubo League would wipe out the
                    protesters from Dhaka within a few minutes. On August 4, students from different parts of the city
                    gathered at Shahbagh to face the imminent, final assault.Musaddiq Ali Ibne Mohammad and AB Jubair, two students of DU, organised the resistance that day.
                    Jubair narrated, “I took around 500 students with me and took position at Shahbagh as we got news
                    that BCL activists may try to enter the campus from there. However, when we reached Shahbagh we did
                    not see any presence of AL.”“Then I learned that some key BCL leaders had taken shelter at BSMMU and a nearby residential hotel.
                    So we surrounded the area. Seeing our manpower, the leaders quickly fled from the hospital, but they
                    set many vehicles on fire to paint us as terrorists. But the fact is our students never entered
                    BSMMU’s premises,” added Mosaddique.According to student coordinators, BCL set vehicles on fire inside BSMMU to paint the protesters as terrorists.Photo:Star.Brutal street fighting between protesters and government forces broke out all over the country.
                    Students, factory workers, rickshaw pullers, street children and people from all walks of life also
                    put up a strong resistance in Ashulia, Uttara, in different parts of Chattogram, Sylhet, Rajshahi,
                    Bogra, Thakurgaon, Rangpur and elsewhere.“Participation of working class people such as rickshaw pullers, transport workers, and factory
                    workers were a major source of strength for us. One street food seller distributed all of his food
                    free of cost for the protesters. Many rickshaw pullers spent their entire day’s income to buy food
                    and water for us,” said Akram. “Many of these people who sacrificed their lives for us might be
                    lying unidentified in some unmarked grave. We must remember these unsung heroes and their stories
                    must be written.”Students united for one demandDuring the July Uprising, students from different political ideologies formed a common alliance under
                    the platform “Students Against Discrimination.”Students from Chhatra Dal, Chhatra Shibir, Chhatra Shakti, Chhatra Union, Chhatra Federation and
                    other different groups and non-political, apolitical students voluntarily worked with each other,
                    leaving behind their differences, to fight against the autocratic regime.Akram, one of the key organisers of the movement, said, “We knew the political orientation of the
                    major figures of this movement. When Hasina’s government started killing people, we realised that
                    this movement was going to be a prolonged campaign. So we asked all the students to leave behind
                    their political differences and remain united to defeat fascism”.On August 5, Sheikh Hasina hastily fled to India leaving behind a legacy of corruption, murder, injustice and a country on the verge of economic collapse.Photo:Star.Hasib, the leader of a left-wing student group Chhatra Union said, “Different student groups that
                    were affiliated with political parties maintained their connection with their political leaders. But
                    till August 5, they never tried to push their political agenda. This is how we could stay united and
                    I believe if there is any attempt to restore fascism, we shall be able to resist again.”Such a sense of collaboration between right-wing student groups like Shibir and left-wing groups is
                    unprecedented in the recent history of Bangladesh. How did such collaboration work?When asked this question, Shadik Kayem said, “We wanted to establish a democratic Bangladesh where
                    people will be able to live with freedom and dignity... We generated ideas together and helped each
                    other organise the movement and motivate the students. I don’t say he or she is the mastermind of
                    the movement. I say that all the students and mass people who helped us and participated are the
                    heroes.”Fall of HasinaOn August 4, when students announced the march to Dhaka programme, at least a million people started
                    their march from different locations. The coordinators disseminated messages to all the districts,
                    instructing people to use different and specific routes to enter Dhaka to avoid bottlenecks and to
                    overwhelm the security forces by rushing in from all sides.Thanks to their strategic planning, by morning hundreds of thousands of people were already marching
                    towards Gono Bhaban, Hasina’s official residence. She hastily fled to India leaving behind a legacy
                    of corruption, murder, injustice and a country on the verge of economic collapse.Nayeem Abedin shared, “We did not think that Hasina would flee. We were actually planning to keep her
                    residence under siege for some time. However, we were overjoyed to know that she was finally gone.”In fact, the students were already worried about their next course of action. According to Abdul
                    Kader, “As we were preparing for a prolonged siege, we did not have the time to think about the
                    post-Hasina government. We were really lucky that Dr Yunus accepted our request and took charge
                    immediately.”Concerns still remainAlmost two months after the fall of Hasina, most of the students did not get a chance to celebrate.
                    Tackling several attempts to destabilise the country, helping the newly-formed government to restore
                    the administration and reaching out to the flood victims, they have been constantly in the field to
                    respond to any crisis that may endanger the interim government.Students who took part in the movement from different political affiliations are now resurfacing in
                    the political scene and claiming their stake in the post-Hasina government. As a result, tensions
                    between different student groups are forming. This has raised a new concern among the students: will
                    Bangladesh return to violent political infighting again?Abdul Kader said, “Different student groups may have varying political ideologies but they must not
                    impose their ideologies on others. Clashes between student groups occur when they start the politics
                    of occupying campuses like they did during the previous regimes. If they try to do so, they are
                    propagating fascism and we shall resist them like we resisted AL.”Mito Akhter opined, “We are afraid that if the conflict between student groups continues to rise,
                    political parties may grab this opportunity to create division among students and exploit them for
                    their own political interest. This is why we proposed that partisan student politics should be
                    banned from universities and central student union-centric politics should be encouraged in the
                    university.”Besides political feuds, students are also concerned about visible discrimination among students
                    belonging to different institutions. There is a sense of deprivation among the students of private
                    universities, madrasas and other institutions who played a major role in the movement but have been
                    “forgotten” after the goal was achieved.Brac’s Afia Jannat Ananna said, “It is really unfortunate that after forming the government, students
                    of private universities have completely been brushed aside. Our role has been forgotten. Many
                    important steps have already been taken by the interim government, but we did not have any chance to
                    share our thoughts and opinions on those matters.”Students are also concerned about preserving the history and essence of the July Uprising. Attempts
                    of disowning the slogans, erasing graffitis and forgetting the protest songs have created concerns.AB Jubair said, “On September 14, two months after the day when we made the historic ‘Razakar’
                    slogan, some student leaders tried to denounce it on social media. I agree that the slogan is heavy
                    with context. But, we should preserve history so that the next generation can learn about the
                    context; we should not denounce it.”Students are also dissatisfied about the fact that the government made no effort to preserve the
                    graffiti and songs that were made during the days of protests. In some places, the graffiti was
                    erased to make way for aesthetic paintings, new slogans or calligraphies.Students are also concerned over many unmet demands that they raised during the protest.“Various demands that we mentioned in the historic nine-point movement have not been implemented,”
                    explains Akram. “Many of those demands are still unfulfilled. Many perpetrators of the massacre are
                    still serving in the administration, and many key political leaders who ordered the massacre are
                    still free. We feel that the administration is not cooperating in this regard, and it is a matter of
                    great concern for us. This is why we have formed the Nagorik Committee so that we can act as a
                    pressure group for the government. I think more pressure groups like these should be formed by the
                    students and conscious people to guide the government.”Md Shahnawaz Khan Chandanis an Assistant Professor at Institute of Education and Research,
                        Jagannath University. He can be contacted at s.nawazk28@yahoo.comBack to Homepage
Shadik Kayem stated, “By then, it was clear that the students’ and people’s protest against Hasina’s
                    rule was no longer about quota reforms. Hasina and her administration must be held accountable for
                    murder, violence, and mass arrest of innocent people.”
With the nine-point demand, students made it clear that abduction or forcing students to issue video
                    statements would not deter them. Continuous pressure from students and civil society, led to all six
                    coordinators being released on August 1.
According to Abdul Kader, “We declared the nine-point demand under incredible government pressure and
                    threats. Our lives were at stake. Meanwhile, students and protesters were urging us to announce a
                    one-point demand: the resignation of Hasina and her government. We realised that without Hasina’s
                    resignation, peace and normalcy would never be restored.”
On August 3, hundreds of thousands of students and the general public joined the “Droho Jatra”,
                    convened by public intellectual Anu Muhammad and organised by university teachers and students,
                    demanding Hasina’s resignation. Later, in the afternoon, the coordinators declared the one-point
                    demand at Shaheed Minar.
The student leaders also called for an all-out non-cooperation movement unless their one-point demand
                    was met.The final battlesThe declaration of the nine-point movement and ultimately the one-point movement sparked massive
                    protests all over the country. Besides Dhaka, every major city and town turned into a battlefield
                    between students alongside common people and government forces.
                    Defying curfew, protesters gathered in thousands at city centres, parks, major streets and other
                    public places demanding Hasina’s resignation and enforcing the blockades and non-cooperation
                    movement.While police, BGB and AL frequently opened fire at protesters, killing them in hundreds, protesters
                    also resisted and drove them away. Some of the most vicious fighting took place in Jatrabari where
                    protesters sacrificed their lives to take control of the Dhaka-Chattrogram highway.The police and Awami League cadres fired live rounds at the protesters.Photo:Rajib RaihanPolice and security forces were deployed with lethal weapons. They gunned down protesters from
                    armoured vehicles and helicopters. Drones flew over and identified exact locations. However, all
                    these weapons and technologies failed in face of sheer courage and determination of the protesters
                    who were armed only with sticks, bamboos and brick chips.Md Burhan Uddin Noman, a lecturer of Daffodil International University, said, “I have seen many dead
                    bodies piled up on one another in the streets of Jatrabari. Police only stopped shooting at the
                    protesters when they ran out of ammunition.”“But still we did not leave the street. We knew that police would hunt us down from our homes if we
                    left. So it was better to die fighting,” added Noman.Students from JU and other nearby institutions, with the help of workers from Savar and Ashulia,
                    blocked Dhaka-Aricha highway. Roadblocks were placed in all major intersections, cutting off Dhaka
                    from most of the northern and southern parts of Bangladesh.Officers from Savar and Ashulia police stations made several attempts to dislodge the protesters
                    using lethal and non-lethal weapons, killing many of them.Hasib Zaman shared, “In the final days of the movement, we found the army on our side. They did not

                    Students, factory workers, rickshaw pullers, street children and people from all walks of life also
                    put up a strong resistance in Ashulia, Uttara, in different parts of Chattogram, Sylhet, Rajshahi,

                    still free. We feel that the administration is not cooperating in this regard, and it is a matter of
                    great concern for us. This is why we have formed the Nagorik Committee so that we can act as a
                    pressure group for the government. I think more pressure groups like these should be formed by the

The final battlesThe declaration of the nine-point movement and ultimately the one-point movement sparked massive
                    protests all over the country. Besides Dhaka, every major city and town turned into a battlefield
                    between students alongside common people and government forces.
                    Defying curfew, protesters gathered in thousands at city centres, parks, major streets and other
                    public places demanding Hasina’s resignation and enforcing the blockades and non-cooperation
                    movement.While police, BGB and AL frequently opened fire at protesters, killing them in hundreds, protesters
                    also resisted and drove them away. Some of the most vicious fighting took place in Jatrabari where
                    protesters sacrificed their lives to take control of the Dhaka-Chattrogram highway.The police and Awami League cadres fired live rounds at the protesters.Photo:Rajib RaihanPolice and security forces were deployed with lethal weapons. They gunned down protesters from
                    armoured vehicles and helicopters. Drones flew over and identified exact locations. However, all
                    these weapons and technologies failed in face of sheer courage and determination of the protesters
                    who were armed only with sticks, bamboos and brick chips.Md Burhan Uddin Noman, a lecturer of Daffodil International University, said, “I have seen many dead
                    bodies piled up on one another in the streets of Jatrabari. Police only stopped shooting at the
                    protesters when they ran out of ammunition.”“But still we did not leave the street. We knew that police would hunt us down from our homes if we
                    left. So it was better to die fighting,” added Noman.Students from JU and other nearby institutions, with the help of workers from Savar and Ashulia,
                    blocked Dhaka-Aricha highway. Roadblocks were placed in all major intersections, cutting off Dhaka
                    from most of the northern and southern parts of Bangladesh.Officers from Savar and Ashulia police stations made several attempts to dislodge the protesters
                    using lethal and non-lethal weapons, killing many of them.Hasib Zaman shared, “In the final days of the movement, we found the army on our side. They did not
                    confront us. Their silent support significantly helped us continue.”In Chattogram, the students staged some of the biggest gatherings the city has ever seen in Lal
                    Dighir Maidan. However, vicious street fighting broke out with AL activists when the students
                    reached Sholashohor station. Students in Bahaddarhat were also resisted by AL.Mohammad Ali said, “BCL cadres... fired at the protesters. The police also fired live rounds at the
                    protesters killing more than 20 of them in the last four days of the movement. On July 4, the
                    Sholashohor railway station switched hands between the protesters and BAL cadres no less than three
                    times.”On August 4, a decisive battle was fought at Shahbagh after which BCL went out of action once and for
                    all.The previous day, BCL threatened that a joint attack by BCL and Jubo League would wipe out the
                    protesters from Dhaka within a few minutes. On August 4, students from different parts of the city
                    gathered at Shahbagh to face the imminent, final assault.Musaddiq Ali Ibne Mohammad and AB Jubair, two students of DU, organised the resistance that day.
                    Jubair narrated, “I took around 500 students with me and took position at Shahbagh as we got news
                    that BCL activists may try to enter the campus from there. However, when we reached Shahbagh we did
                    not see any presence of AL.”“Then I learned that some key BCL leaders had taken shelter at BSMMU and a nearby residential hotel.
                    So we surrounded the area. Seeing our manpower, the leaders quickly fled from the hospital, but they
                    set many vehicles on fire to paint us as terrorists. But the fact is our students never entered
                    BSMMU’s premises,” added Mosaddique.According to student coordinators, BCL set vehicles on fire inside BSMMU to paint the protesters as terrorists.Photo:Star.Brutal street fighting between protesters and government forces broke out all over the country.
                    Students, factory workers, rickshaw pullers, street children and people from all walks of life also
                    put up a strong resistance in Ashulia, Uttara, in different parts of Chattogram, Sylhet, Rajshahi,
                    Bogra, Thakurgaon, Rangpur and elsewhere.“Participation of working class people such as rickshaw pullers, transport workers, and factory
                    workers were a major source of strength for us. One street food seller distributed all of his food
                    free of cost for the protesters. Many rickshaw pullers spent their entire day’s income to buy food
                    and water for us,” said Akram. “Many of these people who sacrificed their lives for us might be
                    lying unidentified in some unmarked grave. We must remember these unsung heroes and their stories
                    must be written.”Students united for one demandDuring the July Uprising, students from different political ideologies formed a common alliance under
                    the platform “Students Against Discrimination.”Students from Chhatra Dal, Chhatra Shibir, Chhatra Shakti, Chhatra Union, Chhatra Federation and
                    other different groups and non-political, apolitical students voluntarily worked with each other,
                    leaving behind their differences, to fight against the autocratic regime.Akram, one of the key organisers of the movement, said, “We knew the political orientation of the
                    major figures of this movement. When Hasina’s government started killing people, we realised that
                    this movement was going to be a prolonged campaign. So we asked all the students to leave behind
                    their political differences and remain united to defeat fascism”.On August 5, Sheikh Hasina hastily fled to India leaving behind a legacy of corruption, murder, injustice and a country on the verge of economic collapse.Photo:Star.Hasib, the leader of a left-wing student group Chhatra Union said, “Different student groups that
                    were affiliated with political parties maintained their connection with their political leaders. But
                    till August 5, they never tried to push their political agenda. This is how we could stay united and
                    I believe if there is any attempt to restore fascism, we shall be able to resist again.”Such a sense of collaboration between right-wing student groups like Shibir and left-wing groups is
                    unprecedented in the recent history of Bangladesh. How did such collaboration work?When asked this question, Shadik Kayem said, “We wanted to establish a democratic Bangladesh where
                    people will be able to live with freedom and dignity... We generated ideas together and helped each
                    other organise the movement and motivate the students. I don’t say he or she is the mastermind of
                    the movement. I say that all the students and mass people who helped us and participated are the
                    heroes.”Fall of HasinaOn August 4, when students announced the march to Dhaka programme, at least a million people started
                    their march from different locations. The coordinators disseminated messages to all the districts,
                    instructing people to use different and specific routes to enter Dhaka to avoid bottlenecks and to
                    overwhelm the security forces by rushing in from all sides.Thanks to their strategic planning, by morning hundreds of thousands of people were already marching
                    towards Gono Bhaban, Hasina’s official residence. She hastily fled to India leaving behind a legacy
                    of corruption, murder, injustice and a country on the verge of economic collapse.Nayeem Abedin shared, “We did not think that Hasina would flee. We were actually planning to keep her
                    residence under siege for some time. However, we were overjoyed to know that she was finally gone.”In fact, the students were already worried about their next course of action. According to Abdul
                    Kader, “As we were preparing for a prolonged siege, we did not have the time to think about the
                    post-Hasina government. We were really lucky that Dr Yunus accepted our request and took charge
                    immediately.”Concerns still remainAlmost two months after the fall of Hasina, most of the students did not get a chance to celebrate.
                    Tackling several attempts to destabilise the country, helping the newly-formed government to restore
                    the administration and reaching out to the flood victims, they have been constantly in the field to
                    respond to any crisis that may endanger the interim government.Students who took part in the movement from different political affiliations are now resurfacing in

                    Bangladesh return to violent political infighting again?Abdul Kader said, “Different student groups may have varying political ideologies but they must not
                    impose their ideologies on others. Clashes between student groups occur when they start the politics
                    of occupying campuses like they did during the previous regimes. If they try to do so, they are
                    propagating fascism and we shall resist them like we resisted AL.”Mito Akhter opined, “We are afraid that if the conflict between student groups continues to rise,
                    political parties may grab this opportunity to create division among students and exploit them for
                    their own political interest. This is why we proposed that partisan student politics should be
                    banned from universities and central student union-centric politics should be encouraged in the
                    university.”Besides political feuds, students are also concerned about visible discrimination among students
                    belonging to different institutions. There is a sense of deprivation among the students of private
                    universities, madrasas and other institutions who played a major role in the movement but have been
                    “forgotten” after the goal was achieved.Brac’s Afia Jannat Ananna said, “It is really unfortunate that after forming the government, students
                    of private universities have completely been brushed aside. Our role has been forgotten. Many
                    important steps have already been taken by the interim government, but we did not have any chance to
                    share our thoughts and opinions on those matters.”Students are also concerned about preserving the history and essence of the July Uprising. Attempts
                    of disowning the slogans, erasing graffitis and forgetting the protest songs have created concerns.AB Jubair said, “On September 14, two months after the day when we made the historic ‘Razakar’
                    slogan, some student leaders tried to denounce it on social media. I agree that the slogan is heavy
                    with context. But, we should preserve history so that the next generation can learn about the
                    context; we should not denounce it.”Students are also dissatisfied about the fact that the government made no effort to preserve the
                    graffiti and songs that were made during the days of protests. In some places, the graffiti was
                    erased to make way for aesthetic paintings, new slogans or calligraphies.Students are also concerned over many unmet demands that they raised during the protest.“Various demands that we mentioned in the historic nine-point movement have not been implemented,”
                    explains Akram. “Many of those demands are still unfulfilled. Many perpetrators of the massacre are
                    still serving in the administration, and many key political leaders who ordered the massacre are
                    still free. We feel that the administration is not cooperating in this regard, and it is a matter of

                    “forgotten” after the goal was achieved.
Brac’s Afia Jannat Ananna said, “It is really unfortunate that after forming the government, students
                    of private universities have completely been brushed aside. Our role has been forgotten. Many
                    important steps have already been taken by the interim government, but we did not have any chance to
                    share our thoughts and opinions on those matters.”
Students are also concerned about preserving the history and essence of the July Uprising. Attempts
                    of disowning the slogans, erasing graffitis and forgetting the protest songs have created concerns.
AB Jubair said, “On September 14, two months after the day when we made the historic ‘Razakar’
                    slogan, some student leaders tried to denounce it on social media. I agree that the slogan is heavy
                    with context. But, we should preserve history so that the next generation can learn about the
                    context; we should not denounce it.”
Students are also dissatisfied about the fact that the government made no effort to preserve the
                    graffiti and songs that were made during the days of protests. In some places, the graffiti was
                    erased to make way for aesthetic paintings, new slogans or calligraphies.
Students are also concerned over many unmet demands that they raised during the protest.
“Various demands that we mentioned in the historic nine-point movement have not been implemented,”
                    explains Akram. “Many of those demands are still unfulfilled. Many perpetrators of the massacre are
                    still serving in the administration, and many key political leaders who ordered the massacre are
                    still free. We feel that the administration is not cooperating in this regard, and it is a matter of
                    great concern for us. This is why we have formed the Nagorik Committee so that we can act as a
                    pressure group for the government. I think more pressure groups like these should be formed by the
                    students and conscious people to guide the government.”

Nearly after over a month, the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission (BTTC) has once again urged the National Board of Revenue (NBR) to withdraw import duties on eggs to cool off local prices.
The commission says that if the current 33 percent duty on eggs continues, imports of the key source of protein for the poor would not make much price difference in the local market.
On August 29, the commission sent an analytical report to the revenue board recommending duty cuts for the import of onions, potatoes and eggs.
On September 4, duties on potato and onion imports were reduced by the revenue board. Consequently, prices of the two food items have largely stabilised in the local market.
Meanwhile, the BTTC informed the NBR today that no steps had been taken to exempt the duty on egg imports as recommended.The commission said egg prices have increased abnormally due to a lack of adequate supply in the local market since the recent flooding and poultry losses in many districts.
According to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), egg prices have increased by 15 percent in the last one month and 20.41 percent in one year.
Due to the recent floods in different districts of the country, the poultry industry has been affected and the price of other supplementary food products has increased abnormally, creating a kind of pressure on the supply system of eggs in the local market, said the commission. It believes allowing egg imports for a brief period would not harm the local poultry industry.
The report mentioned that there is no concern about revenue losses too from the exemption in the short term as there were no egg imports in recent years.
Sumon Howlader, president of the Bangladesh Poultry Association, a platform of local poultry farmers, said small farms across the country produce 4.5 crore eggs every day against the demand of about 4 crore.

American John Hopfield and British-Canadian Geoffrey Hinton won theNobel Prizein Physics on Tuesday for pioneering work in the development of artificial intelligence.
The pair were honoured ""for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks,"" the jury said.
""This year's two Nobel Laureates in Physics have used tools from physics to develop methods that are the foundation of today's powerful machine learning,"" the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences said in a statement.
Hopfield, 91, a professor at Princeton University, was spotlighted for having created ""an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data.""
The jury said Hinton, a 76-year-old professor at the University of Toronto, ""invented a method that can autonomously find properties in data, and so perform tasks such as identifying specific elements in pictures.""
""I'm flabbergasted... I had no idea that could happen,"" Hinton told reporters via a phone interview as the winners of the award were announced in Stockholm.

The pair will receive their prize, consisting of a diploma, a gold medal and a $1 million cheque, from King Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.
Last year, the Nobel Prize in Physics went to France's Pierre Agostini, Hungarian-Austrian Ferenc Krausz and Franco-Swede Anne L'Huillier for research using ultra quick light flashes that enable the study of electrons inside atoms and molecules.
The Nobel season continues this week with the announcement of the winner, or winners, of the chemistry prize on Wednesday -- followed by the much-anticipated prizes for literature on Thursday and peace on Friday.
The Economics Prize winds things up on Monday, October 14.
Awarded since 1901, the Nobel Prizes honour those who have, in the words of prize creator and scientist Alfred Nobel, ""conferred the greatest benefit on humankind"".

A Dhaka court today summoned Tapasi Tabassum Urmi, the suspended assistant commissioner of Lalmonirhat, in a case filed over her ""derogatory remarks"" about Abu Sayed, who was killed in police firing during the quota reform movement on July 16.
Tapasi will have to appear before the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Zakir Hossain on November 28 and seek bail in the case, according to the order.
If she fails appear before the court, an arrest warrant will be issued against her, the court said.
Earlier in the day, Abu Hanif, a member of the higher council of Gono Adhikar Parishad, filed the case against her with the same court.
Upon hearing, the magistrate recorded the statement of the complainant and later, issued the summon order.
Abu Sayed, a 12th batch student of the English department at Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur and a coordinator of the anti-quota movement, was the first student killed in police firing during the movement.
Tapasi, who drew attention for her Facebook post criticising the interim government and the chief adviser, was suspended yesterday.
Earlier, she was transferred to the Rangpur Divisional Commissioner's Office and made officer on special duty (OSD) due to what officials say are her controversial Facebook posts and criticism of Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus.
On October 5, she wrote on Facebook that the interim government has no constitutional basis.
""The countdown has begun for you, sir,"" she wrote, addressing the chief adviser.

Salman Agha knocked a fiery half-century to foil England's fightback on Tuesday, as Pakistan reached 515-8 at tea on day two of the opening Test in Multan.
The 30-year-old was unbeaten on 79 alongside Shaheen Shah Afridi, 13, after England took two wickets in each of the two sessions on a batting-friendly pitch.
Agha survived a catch off spinner Jack Leach, when Chris Woakes lobbed the ball from behind the boundary line and caught it inside the ground.
However the third umpire ruled the fielder's foot touched the ground beyond the rope and gave a six.
Agha has cracked 10 fours and two sixes in his eighth Test fifty and went past 1,000 runs in his 15th Test.
Agha added an invaluable 57 runs for the seventh wicket with Saud Shakeel, who was caught smartly by Joe Root at slip off Shoaib Bashir for 82. Shakeel hit eight fours.
Pace bowler Brydon Carse has figures of 2-74 on his debut after trapping Aamer Jamal for seven, adding to his first Test wicket of Naseem Shah who was caught at leg slip by Harry Brook before lunch for 33.
Resuming at 328-4, Shakeel and Shah put on a sedate stand of 64 as England's bowlers kept it tight with just 69 coming in the first session.
Fast bowler Gus Atkinson has figures of 2-99, spinner Jack Leach has 2-136, including the wicket of Mohammed Rizwan before lunch, while Woakes and Bashir have taken a wicket apiece.

A section of students have been staging a protest in Dhaka's Gulistan area this afternoon, demanding justice for 19-year-old Imam Hasan Taim, who was fatally shot dead during the anti-discrimination movement.
The demonstration, which began around 1:30pm, brought traffic to a standstill in Gulistan, leaving commuters stranded for hours.
Taim, a student of Government Adamjee Nagar MW College in Narayanganj, was the son of Sub-Inspector Mainal Hossain Bhuiyan.
The majority of the protesters were the fellow students of taim. They carried banners and chanted slogans, calling for the arrest of those responsible for his death.
Taim was shot and killed by police on July 20 in Jatrabari's Kajla area.
His brother, Rabiul, said, ""Two months have passed, and the people who killed my brother are still free.""
Law enforcement, including police and army personnel, were deployed to the scene to manage the situation. They urged the students to leave and allow traffic to resume, but the protest continued, causing severe gridlock in the area.
Anwar Sayed, deputy commissioner of Traffic (Motijheel Zone), told The Daily Star, ""The Zero Point area is still blocked as of 2:40pm. We are working to divert vehicles through alternative routes.""
He added that the roadblocks had extended traffic congestion to Gulistan and surrounding roads.

The tiger population in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, has increased by 11 since the last survey in 2018, according to the latest ""Sundarbans Tiger Survey 2024"".
In the 2018 survey, the number of tigers was recorded at 114, whereas 125 tigers were found in the latest survey.
Syeda Rizwana Hasan, adviser of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, shared this information during a press conference held at the Secretariat today.
Rizwana said, ""The 2023-24 tiger survey conducted in the Sundarbans found the tiger population to be 125, with a density of 2.64 tigers per 100 square kilometres of the forest.""
""To determine the tiger population, the first modern camera trapping survey was conducted in 2015, which estimated the tiger population at 106. At that time, the tiger density per 100 square kilometres was 2.17.""
The 2023-24 survey also observed a significant number of tiger cubs, though they were not included in the official count due to the high mortality rate among cubs as they grow into adulthood.
MA Aziz, professor of Zoology at Jahangirnagar University, said, ""The Sundarbans provides a favourable environment for tiger breeding, and it is likely that the tiger population will continue to grow in the future.""

Urban landscape defines its soundscape, which varies from one neighbourhood to another. Urbanites must deal with two types of sound: one produced inside the house and another from outside the home. In urban areas, cacophony triumphs over symphony. Cacophony ranges from automobile honking to thunderous din of construction work. Even at midnight, the honking does not stop. Revving engines makes the situation worse. We are always on the move. Night is not the time to rest rather, it seems to be a time of busy schedules. Products are delivered from door to door. The virtual marketplace provides the symbols of real-life objects. By placing orders, we bring cacophony within our earshot.
Automobiles, by compressing time with their fuel-driven engines have become an indispensable part of our lives. Time is always in short supply. Our fast and furious biographies always need a touch of perfection. We cannot afford to use our feet or ride a cattle cart to reach our destination. We cover long distances by using machines to minimise the time. Time has become synonymous with zero-sum game money.
Modern shelters are constructed to accommodate the growing population producing unbearable noise by piling machines. It does not stop even at night. People can hardly sleep in this environment. Construction work is a nightmarish experience for the residents who have very little power to change the scenario. The flat owners are in a Catch-22 situation, whereas the tenants have the option of moving out. The gigantic and unimpressive machines of construction work create a feeling of helplessness by producing massive noise.
Dogs bark to claim their porous territory against other dogs. Cats fight against other cats for the same reason. Their respective calls make their presence felt in an environment riddled with machine noise. The prolonged barking of dogs sometimes numbs our hearing power. At night, sounds of dogs barking become audible, remaining shrouded under automobile honking during daytime. Slogans make their presence felt when the political situation is volatile. During the blackout, the diesel generators spew out black smoke producing deafening noise. Movie theatres hammer on the senses by creating a pool of surround sound.
Peddlers shout the name of their commodities to attract potential buyers. They sell a range of items from hot patties to peanuts to vegetables. They also peddle fish and hurl the names at the residents to find their prospective vendees. Beggars beg for alms by their repetitive appeal. Their voices remain an integral part of the urban soundscape.
Airplanes help us reach our destination within the shortest possible time. The growling sound of their engines does not allow us to hear our mutual conversation. Sound pollution from airplanes is a unique phenomenon of modern civilisation. Calling bells in their varieties of sounds breaks our usual engagements to address the issue outside the door. Being startled by the sound we rush towards the door. Calling bells break our temporary meditation and bring anxiety. Sometimes to the chagrin of the residents, mischievous children ring the bell and run away. Television is another source of voluminous sound inside the room produced voluntarily by the inhabitants. Serials and their accompanying sounds produce suspense along with their repeated close-ups travel across the neighbourhood. Movie theatres are replicated at home with the help of hi-fi sound.
The wailing sound of ambulances signals the transportation of sick passengers. The siren of the fire service truck makes everyone alert about an incident of the nearby fire. Both ambulances and fire service trucks point to the crisis in a situation. Drilling machines produce disturbing noise that we cannot escape from. Aluminium glass and brick walls erected to stave off unwelcome sounds from roads and highways struggle to live up to the expectation.
The Muslim call to prayer five times daily remains the constant companion of the residents. The muazzin in his soothing and enchanting voice calls the practicing Muslims to the mosques. Azaan finds its way into our lives due to the Muslim majority of the population. When I had to live for certain days in Mukundapur in India, I did not hear azaan at all as it was a Hindu-dominated area. There, Hindu religious songs were played on microphones all day long during different festivals. Religion determines the types of sound in a geographical location.
Musical concerts organised by the bride's and groom's family as part of the wedding ceremony in the winter make the situation a terrible one. Ceiling fans fail to hide the noise as they remain out of use due to the colder temperature. In winter the honking of automobiles gets on our nerves, and it feels like the vehicles are moving not on the road but inside the rooms.
The symphony of nature is also felt in the urban soundscape. Birds chirping cheer us up giving the torch of rejuvenation. The rhythm of torrential rain is heard quite often in the monsoon. The sound of jackals or crickets is missing from the urban soundscape. Thunder rumbles during the monsoon helping us to forget the machine-generated noise for a while. The opportunity cost is too heavy for us to deal with in urban areas. The future of urban soundscape is not going to improve in terms of machine-derived sound before we become partially or fully deaf.

The World Risk Index 2023 ranks Bangladesh ninth worldwide for climate disaster risk. By 2050, Bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its territory due to rising sea levels, resulting in thelossof 30 percent of the country's agricultural land. The rise in sea levels in coastal areas is prompting mass migration into cities, further straining the country's resources. With a disaster risk score of 27.29, Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to natural hazards such as floods, cyclones, and coastal erosion.
Coastal erosion and rising sea levels
Bangladesh's geography makes it especially prone to the impacts of climate change. With a flat landscape and a significant portion of the country lying below five meters above sea level, rising sea levels present a dire threat. The coastal regions, home to millions, are facing erosion and salinisation, rendering fertile land unsuitable for agriculture. A projected loss of 17 percent of Bangladesh's landmass would displace millions of people, many of whom depend on agriculture and fishing for their livelihood.
To address these challenges, the Bangladeshi government has taken the lead in integrating migration into its climate adaptation strategies. Government funding, combined with international support, has focused on providing climate-vulnerable communities with more secure housing and sustainable livelihood opportunities. Initiatives have targeted areas along the coast and encouraged internal migration to secondary cities, such as Mongla, in an attempt to reduce pressure on major urban centres. Notably, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Patrick V Verkooijen, head of the Global Center on Climate Adaptation, have praised Bangladesh as a ""global pioneer in preparing for climate migrants.""
Agricultural disruption and migration pressuresClimate change is severely disrupting Bangladesh's agricultural sector, the backbone of its economy. The erratic rainfall patterns and more frequent cyclones have caused significant damage to crops. Farmers are struggling to cope with changes to traditional growing seasons, and the increasing salinity of soil in coastal regions is reducing the yield of key crops like rice. As a result, food insecurity is becoming an alarming issue.This disruption has contributed to internal migration, as families leave rural areas in search of better opportunities. Although most climate-related displacement in Bangladesh remains internal, neighbouring India has also become a destination for migrants, compounding broader migration pressures rooted in cultural, historical, and economic factors. However, international agreements addressing the legal status of climate refugees remain absent, leaving many migrants vulnerable to legal and employment challenges. India's proposed Climate Migrants (Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill 2022, though not yet passed, signals a growing recognition of the issue. The bill sought to create a legal framework to protect climate migrants, ensuring access to employment, education, and other services. While the legislation stalled, it reflects the region's need for coordinated responses to climate migration​.Urban vulnerability: The strain on DhakaAs rural communities migrate to cities to escape climate impacts, Dhaka, already one of the world's most densely populated cities, is struggling to cope. The capital city is experiencing frequent flash floods due to unplanned urban development and a poor drainage system. As a result, waterlogging has become a regular occurrence during the monsoon season, disrupting the lives of millions. In addition to floods, Dhaka faces extreme heat, exacerbated by the urban heat island effect. With minimal green spaces and insufficient infrastructure to handle the surging population, the city's resilience to climate impacts is being tested.Read moreClimate crisis and Bangladesh's toxic tangle with arsenicGovernment-led adaptation effortsBangladesh has been proactive in its efforts to combat the impacts of climate change. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) serves as the country's blueprint for adaptation and resilience. This plan includes significant investments in flood defences, early warning systems, and disaster shelters. Over the years, Bangladesh has gained international recognition for its disaster preparedness, especially in reducing cyclone-related deaths through improved warning systems and the construction of cyclone shelters. Despite these efforts, the magnitude of the climate crisis is making it increasingly difficult to keep up. Bangladesh, as a developing country, faces constraints in terms of finance and technical resources. Many of its adaptation projects remain underfunded, with gaps in data and knowledge limiting the effectiveness of some interventions​.International support and future prospectsTo address the climate crisis, Bangladesh needs more than local efforts. The country has been a vocal advocate for climate finance, urging developed nations to fulfil their commitments to the Green Climate Fund and other international support mechanisms. Global cooperation is crucial, especially as Bangladesh's adaptation efforts require substantial investments. At the international level, Bangladesh is actively involved in climate diplomacy, advocating for more ambitious targets to curb global temperature rise and support vulnerable nations like itself.

At a time when Dhaka University students are facing a severe accommodation crisis—with many forced to share beds and reading tables or live in unhygienic conditions in the overcrowded dormitories—it is disconcerting to see many acres of university land remainingunutilised or lost. Despite calls to take action in this regard, there has been little effort to reclaim or repurpose these areas for student housing or educational facilities. Reportedly, the DU began its journey with 650 acres of land. Of them, only 274 acres have been effectively utilised. Alarmingly, over 12 acres have been lost due to the negligence of the university's estate office, while some 51.99 acres allotted by the government remain unused due to a lack of funding. This is quite unfortunate.
Read moreOur expectations from Dhaka UniversityEvidently, the land issues have been exacerbated by the fact that the university has yet to implement the masterplan drawn up in 2021, which could bring much-needed infrastructural improvements to the campus. This masterplan envisions 17 new academic buildings, 24 residential halls for students, 34 residential buildings for faculty and staff, and a modern library. It also involves renovating existing structures, constructing a multi-storey facility at the Teacher-Student Centre (TSC), installing solar power, creating dedicated walking and cycling lanes, and building an underground road from Shahbagh to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Chankharpul. The question is: how can the DU implement this ambitious plan if it cannot even recover its land?For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Read moreDU must lead by example in abolishing partisan politicsIt is understandable that reclaiming lost land during the previous regime may have been fraught with political challenges.

Completing a tour at theESMA Museum and Site of Memory, located on the grounds of what was once the officers' quarters of the Navy School of Mechanics (ESMA), in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, takes around90 minutes. The museum, which was a former clandestine centre of detention, torture, and extermination, features 17 rooms hosting traditional and contemporary museographic exhibits centred around survivor testimonies, historical documents from the National Commission on the Disappearance of People, the Trial of the Military Junta, declassified state documents, among other archives.
During the military dictatorship in Argentinafrom 1976 to 1983, the officers' quarters at ESMA became a key site for suppressing the opposition as part of a national strategy. Thousands of people, both armed and peaceful, were abducted in Buenos Aires, brought to ESMA, and subjected to interrogation, torture, and often death.Some 5,000of the approximately 30,000 people who disappeared at the hands of the military junta during those years passed through ESMA, making it the largest torture centre of that era.
After the crimes committed on the site became known, and after years of uncertainty about its future, the recovery process to transform the ESMA premises into a Space for Memory and for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights began in 2004. On May 19, 2015, after years of debates and consensus reaching, the ESMA Museum and Site of Memory was inaugurated.In September 2023, UNESCO recognised it as a World Heritage Site, a site of ""outstanding universal value"" that belongs to the common heritage of humanity.
Read morePolitical literacy needed now more than everAccording to UNESCO, the building has been protected as judicial evidence since 1998 owing to the crimes against humanity committed there during its operations as a clandestine detention and extermination centre. From then on, any kind of modification was prohibited. In the present day, all efforts to conserve and restore the building are guided by scientific studies, aimed at preserving it both as a piece of legal evidence and as a valuable historical record. That's why all kinds ofmarkings and inscriptions, denoting the stay of the detained-disappeared at the place, are preserved. These include different types of inscriptions on the walls, as well as on both the iron and wooden structures in the building. There are markings that were made with unidentified sharp objects, and others with ink or graphite: names, phone numbers, initials, inscriptions of party affiliations, dates, drawings.That is why it is very important to preserve the secret detention centres in Bangladesh, popularly known as ""Aynaghar,"" used for enforced disappearances during the Hasina regime due to its huge historical, heritage, and judicial value as evidence in carrying out crimes against humanity. In Argentina, evidence dating back more than 40 years remains intact, but in Bangladesh, within two months of the fall of the Hasina regime, many kinds of evidence of enforced disappearances have been destroyed.The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, which was formed to investigate cases of enforced disappearances during the past Awami League government, has found evidence of destroyed materials at the secret detention centre run by the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI). Messages, names, phone numbers, and addresses written on the walls of the detention centre by the victims were erased by painting over the walls. Not only that, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) want to destroy the secret prisons to protect their image on an international level. Furthermore, according to a report by the daily Samakal, work is underway to demolish the cells inside the DGFI-run detention centre and change the interior of the one-story building.Read moreWriting in the time of autocracyBut keeping Bangladesh's secret detention centres intact, like Argentina's, is important for both legal and historical reasons. Allowing the demolition or alteration of Aynaghar in the name of protecting the international image of LEAs would on the one hand destroy important evidence for the trial and on the other hand create an opportunity to deny historical truth in the future.According to theAsian Human Rights Commission(AHRC), at least 623 people were victims of enforced disappearance in the country from 2009 to 2022. Of those, 84 bodies were recovered, 383 were either returned alive or shown arrested later. Still missing are 153 people, and there is no information about three others.Within two days of Hasina's government being overthrown in a mass uprising, several of the missing persons have returned from the secret detention centres, but many are still missing; many others do not know what happened to their relatives. The aforementioned commission had received nearly400complaints of forced disappearances within two weeks of starting their work. There are also many questions about who were involved in the disappearance. Even in the cases where people have returned alive, it is not clear who detained them and where.The LEAs that were involved in enforced disappearances during the Hasina regime are still the same with no fundamental changes. The LEAs have not acknowledged the responsibility, nor revealed who were involved in the enforced disappearances. Rather, they seem to be actively destroying the evidence of enforced disappearances.Read moreWe must never let such an environment of fear reign againNot only as legal evidence, but to ensure that the forced disappearances do not happen again in the future, it is important to keep the history of Aynaghar alive and intact. As the then Argentine president Alberto Fernández explained, ""Collective memory is what keeps people from repeating their histories and allows them to move forward towards a better future.""That's why, not only Argentina, but many other countries around the world which had suffered from enforced disappearance or state terrorism, have taken various steps to preserve the memories. For example,Villa Grimaldi, an old villa on the edge of Chile's capital city of Santiago, which was used as a major torture centre from 1974-78 during the rule of General Pinochet, has been converted as a sitios de memoria or memory sites in 1995, to remember those who had suffered and died under the military's rule. About 5,000 prisoners passed through Villa Grimaldi, and it is known that 240 of them were killed or disappeared.Answers to many questions related to disappearances in Bangladesh are still unknown, including who were involved in the enforced disappearance of how many people, what happened to the persons who are still missing, who were the masterminds of the enforced disappearance, what were the command structures and motivations, etc. In order to know the answers to these questions, bring the perpetrators under justice, and prevent the recurrence of enforced disappearances in future, it is utmost important to preserve all types of evidence related to enforced disappearance. I hope the interim government will take appropriate steps in this regard before it is too late.Kallol Mustafais an engineer and writer who focuses on power, energy, environment and development economics.

Fifty years ago, in October 1974, Abul Hashim, a prominent political leader of the then dissolved Bengal Provincial Muslim League (BPML) breathed his last in Bangladesh, leaving behind an important political legacy now long forgotten. Hashim had been an active member of the BPML and even served as its general secretary in the 1940s, important years leading up to the partition of British India. Buried deep under the enormous amount of historical literature, narratives and counter-narratives that deal with the Bengal province of that period, Hashim is often reduced to a footnote for his important contribution towards the United Bengal Plan of 1947.
The plan had been a last plea to the British government by the Bengal Congress and the BPML to keep Bengal united under all costs. It further demanded independence of this united Bengal and the establishment of a new Bengali nation-state with its eastern and western parts kept intact. A closer examination of this plan and Hashim's writings on issues related to nation-state, religion and modernity reveal a much deeper and profound understanding of his vision on the becoming of a nation that truly deserves a proper place in the existing academic discourse on nation-theory.
The general way to understand the construction of modern nation-states is typical through either of two frameworks or categories. First where nations and national sentiment sometimes is built around affective notions of solidarity, religion, and a sense of shared past, values, territory and practices. The second is the formation of nations built on instituting laws which are universal and secular. Throughout history, we have had nations which have been either ethnic or civic or more rarely a combination of the two. It is generally taken for granted that a nation can only be ethnic or civic and not be both together where ethnic identities and civic universalism are co-constituted.
In some sense Hashim's United Bengal plan was the political iteration of his deep philosophical understanding of what a nation truly ought to be. For Abul Hashim any new formulation of how a nation ought to take into consideration a new kind of public/political morality will have to seek to overcome narrow ethnic-religious prejudices and the myriad of problems associated with a society divided by both social and class inequalities.It is within this dual framework that my new book 'Theorizing a Bengali Nation: Abul Hashim and the United Bengal Movement 1937-1947' places Hashim's political contributions and philosophical iterations on what is a nation where I argue, he offers a third framework. He articulated the demand for a nationalist identity that would cut across Hindu-Muslim differences in the Bengal province by encouraging political emphasis on certain narrative commonalities. These narrative commonalities for him, were formed through the sharing of inter-subjective communicative practices, particularly culture, language and society that made possible the existence of what I term, a historical aesthetic identity for the political collective regardless of their constituting individual religious identities. The idea of aesthetic identity that was working within Abul Hashim was an attempt to imagine a nation that would be both civic and ethnic at the same time.This aesthetic idea of a united Bengali nation would be created on common ethnic lines and at the same time, commit itself fully to the universal ideals of a modern, secular nation-state. Hashim thought that this would counter the pressures of majoritarian politics and also defy the logic of viewing civic and ethnic identities as binaries and instead treat them as co-constitutive elements that together produce one kind of nationalist identity or character for a people. This tendency to synthesize two elements of a nation's political life can be seen in different stages of Hashim's life. We can divide his life into a political one and a religious one. Ultimately, Hashim wanted to help people think of these not as opposed binaries but opportunities for practical and intellectual co-habitation. Let me first take up Hashim's political trajectory through events that overlapped with his life and the larger political scenario.Hashim and PoliticsAbul Hashim came from a prominent political family in Burdwan (in West Bengal) where he grew up before moving to Calcutta as a young adult, to study law. His father Abul Kasem was a Congressman and had worked quite closely with one of the Congress founding members, Surendranath Banerjea. Kasem's participation in the Swadeshi (1905-11), Khilafat and Non-cooperation movements (1919-22) had left an indelible impression on young Hashim's mind who became interested in understanding the nature of social and political life in British India. Hashim's political debut came in 1936 when he participated in the Bengal Legislative Council, which was the upper house of the legislature of Bengal. In March 1940 he attended the Lahore conference held by the Muslim League where the All India Muslim League (AIML) party declared and passed for the first time a resolution stating that all Muslim majority provinces in British India should be allowed to become independent states. This became known as the Lahore Resolution.At the conference, Bengal's then Prime Minister, Fazlul Huq who formally presented this resolution, emphasized that the resolution hopes to bring independence to all Muslim majority provinces in British India. Hashim later writes about the Lahore conference and Fazlul Huq's presentation of the Resolution as evidence of the nature of the relationship between the AIML and BMPL. The latter saw the AIML as an ally rather than a parent body and believed strongly that Bengal must be considered a distinct Muslim majority province that deserved to function as an autonomous unit in the event of independence. Huq was an enormously influential figure in Bengal's political history who served as Prime Minister of the province for six years and his political career, pre-independence, spanned over thirty years.Cover of Abul Hashim’s autobiographyWhen Huq resigned from the Muslim League in March 1943, Khawaja Nazimuddin succeeded him as the premier of Bengal. Nazimuddin belonged to an aristocratic nawab family and much of his politics was shaped by his class position. Politically he was conservative and keen on a separate homeland for Muslims and subsequently became quite opposed to the United Bengal plan. His two-year term as premier of Bengal between 1943-45, were tumultuous and some political factions, even within the Muslim League in Bengal felt his politics was isolating the ordinary masses. H. S. Suhrawardy, who served as the last premier of Bengal undivided, before the province was partitioned at the time of independence, resented the Nazimuddin government and had his own political ambitions that led him to finally create an opposing faction against Nazimuddin within the Muslim League party.Later on, in 1946 Suhrawardy led a successful political campaign and was elected the new Premier of Bengal. Suhrawardy was then able to encourage Hashim to play a more active role in the province's politics. In the years leading up to the legislative assembly elections of 1946, Suhrawardy encouraged Hashim to take on the task of reviving the Muslim League's image in the province as a more mass-based party, very much in touch with grass-root politics.The Lahore Resolution in some ways could be seen as a prelude to a larger United Bengal scheme that emerged later on as it highlighted the possibilities of creating Muslim state(s) in the subcontinent. Hashim's approach to this possibility was not a consolidated religious nation-state but rather a nation state of Bengal, tied up by supra-community commitments, mainly bound by common language and cultural practices between Bengali Hindus and Bengali Muslims. For him, the Indian subcontinent represented the same thing as Europe, made up of autonomous sovereign units bound by a historically constructed idea of Europeanness. To Hashim, the Indian subcontinent and all its various composing units should strive for the same in their anti-colonial struggles.Hashim and ReligionA key turning point in Hashim's life came in 1942 when he met a Gorakhpur-based theologian and philosopher Moulana Azad Subhani who at the time was working on reconstructing Islamic thought around the philosophical question of what it is to be human. Subhani introduced Hashim to the philosophy of 'Rabbaniyat' or Rabbanism'. The term is derived from the word Rab which refers to the grand architect, creator and sustainer of the universe. Rabbaniyat creates a phislophical route to engage with the idea of becoming a self through the divine ways of creation and evolution.Hashim writes, ""Rabbaniyat in concrete term means physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual development of man according to divine way of creation, sustenance and evolution of the universe visible in nature, in Al-Quran and in the life of the Holy Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him). Al-Quran and the prophet did not teach a newfangled way of life but confirmed what was taught by other prophets, sages and philosophers of the world. 'Rabbaniyat' is the first principle of Islamic values.'Rab' is the greatest attributive name of Allah and other attributes are contributory and complementary to this basic attribute. One who in theory and practice adopts 'Rabbaniyat' is called a 'Rabbani'. People talk glibly about Islamic state without the slightest idea as to what it actually means. A state which faithfully implements 'Rabbaniyat' in individual and collective life of the citizens is an Islamic State. Today, there is nowhere in the world a living Islamic social organism"". (Abul Hashim, In Retrospection (Subarna Publishers, Dhaka, 1974, pp. 40–41)Cover of Sucharita Sen’s book.Hashim saw Rabbaniyat also as a method to construct a cultural sense of religion that seems to be based on a moral understanding which emphasized the possibility of constructing the self through a kind of spiritual satiation that comes through religion but doesn't conform the individual to doctrines or tenets. It instead allows one to discover aesthetic symbols of community life and encourages the self to merge with the collective in a harmonious manner. This, he felt is attained through religion and not outside of it. He believed that in some ways this message was found universally in all religions. Hashim took great efforts in incorporating these views into his political life which subsequently started to resonate with a lot of young Muslims in the province who were eager to find a political voice for themselves.This helped expand the membership of the Muslim League in Bengal and aided in its overall revival in the 1940s. There are delightful anecdotes in his autobiography about how enthusiastic these new members were in refurnishing and renovating the League office at No. 3 Wellesly [sic] lane, Calcutta which subsequently became an important place to plan the day-to-day political functioning of the party. For Hashim, and several other members like him, Dhaka and Calcutta were the two main political and cultural centres of the Bengal province.Merging of Politics and ReligionIn 1946, Hashim was fully invested in drawing up a plan for Bengal's post independent existence that would produce the least amount of violence and bypass the horrible fate of being partitioned. During Lord Wavell's last phase as Viceroy of India, it became quite clear that the AIML leadership and the Congress high command were unable to cooperate on several political decisions regarding independence- partition was going to be inevitable. Hashim found in Bengal Congress' Sarat Chandra Bose a sympathiser and someone who had become quite interested in the United Bengal Plan.Towards the end of 1946, Hashim met Bose where he shared with him some of his ideas on the ideal kind of nation that would incorporate a multicultural ethos in its political sovereignty and imbibe a secular citizenship that wouldn't necessary be achieved through the bifurcation of state and religion but a co-constitution of the two. Bose who had earlier been sceptical of the Pakistan plan came around to Hashim's views on the necessity to save the province from being partitioned. Bose believed like Hashim, that India was a federation of different units and there was no reason for the province of Bengal to not demand complete autonomy.This collaboration between Hashim and Bose led to the drafting of a formal proposal for a United Bengal that I have reproduced in my book. One of the clauses in the proposal was to have a system of joint electorates with reservation of seats proportionate to the population of Hindus and Muslims in the free state of Bengal. At the time of partition, the Bengal ministry would be dissolved and replaced with a new interim ministry with equal number of members from the two main religious groups. The Chief Minister would be a Muslim and the Home Minister a Hindu. Positions in military and administrative functions will be equally filled by Hindu and Muslim members.The proposal failed to gain any support especially in the aftermath of the Calcutta Killings (August 1946) that locked the two communities into a state of hostility and mutual suspicion. The proposal also got no support from the Bengal Congress despite Sarat Bose's influence. Some within the Congress also saw partition as an opportunity to carve out a more prosperous western state with the industries in Asansol and Raniganj and also Calcutta with its port. The tussle for political power, the promise of economic prosperity and the sheer nature of political self-determinism against colonial rule all produced a sense of chaos and uncertainty.In this chaos, the United Bengal plan should be seen as a symbol of cooperation and solidarity. But more than that it should be seen as an important attempt to treat ethnicity as something that can be defined beyond the scope of religion where one can actualise the sense of true belonging through shared commonalities. This for Hashim is a universal trait and in Bengal's case could be achieved through religion. Religious tenets must be made to commit themselves to the rule of law and most importantly to a sense of duty towards one's self in order to achieve a kind of spiritual becoming that ultimately dissolves the lines between individual and community.In some sense Hashim's United Bengal plan was the political iteration of his deep philosophical understanding of what a nation truly ought to be. For Abul Hashim any new formulation of how a nation ought to take into consideration a new kind of public/political morality will have to seek to overcome narrow ethnic-religious prejudices and the myriad of problems associated with a society divided by both social and class inequalities. Through his life and work, Hashim worked to develop a possibility of reimagine the role of religion as an essential tool to truly liberate the human spirit.Sucharita Sen is Associate Professor of politics at the Jindal School of Liberal Arts and Humanities (JSLH), O.P.

This, he felt is attained through religion and not outside of it. He believed that in some ways this message was found universally in all religions.

There are delightful anecdotes in his autobiography about how enthusiastic these new members were in refurnishing and renovating the League office at No. 3 Wellesly [sic] lane, Calcutta which subsequently became an important place to plan the day-to-day political functioning of the party. For Hashim, and several other members like him, Dhaka and Calcutta were the two main political and cultural centres of the Bengal province.Merging of Politics and ReligionIn 1946, Hashim was fully invested in drawing up a plan for Bengal's post independent existence that would produce the least amount of violence and bypass the horrible fate of being partitioned. During Lord Wavell's last phase as Viceroy of India, it became quite clear that the AIML leadership and the Congress high command were unable to cooperate on several political decisions regarding independence- partition was going to be inevitable. Hashim found in Bengal Congress' Sarat Chandra Bose a sympathiser and someone who had become quite interested in the United Bengal Plan.Towards the end of 1946, Hashim met Bose where he shared with him some of his ideas on the ideal kind of nation that would incorporate a multicultural ethos in its political sovereignty and imbibe a secular citizenship that wouldn't necessary be achieved through the bifurcation of state and religion but a co-constitution of the two. Bose who had earlier been sceptical of the Pakistan plan came around to Hashim's views on the necessity to save the province from being partitioned. Bose believed like Hashim, that India was a federation of different units and there was no reason for the province of Bengal to not demand complete autonomy.This collaboration between Hashim and Bose led to the drafting of a formal proposal for a United Bengal that I have reproduced in my book. One of the clauses in the proposal was to have a system of joint electorates with reservation of seats proportionate to the population of Hindus and Muslims in the free state of Bengal. At the time of partition, the Bengal ministry would be dissolved and replaced with a new interim ministry with equal number of members from the two main religious groups. The Chief Minister would be a Muslim and the Home Minister a Hindu. Positions in military and administrative functions will be equally filled by Hindu and Muslim members.The proposal failed to gain any support especially in the aftermath of the Calcutta Killings (August 1946) that locked the two communities into a state of hostility and mutual suspicion. The proposal also got no support from the Bengal Congress despite Sarat Bose's influence. Some within the Congress also saw partition as an opportunity to carve out a more prosperous western state with the industries in Asansol and Raniganj and also Calcutta with its port. The tussle for political power, the promise of economic prosperity and the sheer nature of political self-determinism against colonial rule all produced a sense of chaos and uncertainty.In this chaos, the United Bengal plan should be seen as a symbol of cooperation and solidarity. But more than that it should be seen as an important attempt to treat ethnicity as something that can be defined beyond the scope of religion where one can actualise the sense of true belonging through shared commonalities. This for Hashim is a universal trait and in Bengal's case could be achieved through religion. Religious tenets must be made to commit themselves to the rule of law and most importantly to a sense of duty towards one's self in order to achieve a kind of spiritual becoming that ultimately dissolves the lines between individual and community.In some sense Hashim's United Bengal plan was the political iteration of his deep philosophical understanding of what a nation truly ought to be. For Abul Hashim any new formulation of how a nation ought to take into consideration a new kind of public/political morality will have to seek to overcome narrow ethnic-religious prejudices and the myriad of problems associated with a society divided by both social and class inequalities. Through his life and work, Hashim worked to develop a possibility of reimagine the role of religion as an essential tool to truly liberate the human spirit.Sucharita Sen is Associate Professor of politics at the Jindal School of Liberal Arts and Humanities (JSLH), O.P. Jindal Global University (O.P. JGU), Haryana, India.
A key turning point in Hashim's life came in 1942 when he met a Gorakhpur-based theologian and philosopher Moulana Azad Subhani who at the time was working on reconstructing Islamic thought around the philosophical question of what it is to be human. Subhani introduced Hashim to the philosophy of 'Rabbaniyat' or Rabbanism'. The term is derived from the word Rab which refers to the grand architect, creator and sustainer of the universe. Rabbaniyat creates a phislophical route to engage with the idea of becoming a self through the divine ways of creation and evolution.
Hashim writes, ""Rabbaniyat in concrete term means physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual development of man according to divine way of creation, sustenance and evolution of the universe visible in nature, in Al-Quran and in the life of the Holy Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him). Al-Quran and the prophet did not teach a newfangled way of life but confirmed what was taught by other prophets, sages and philosophers of the world. 'Rabbaniyat' is the first principle of Islamic values.
'Rab' is the greatest attributive name of Allah and other attributes are contributory and complementary to this basic attribute. One who in theory and practice adopts 'Rabbaniyat' is called a 'Rabbani'. People talk glibly about Islamic state without the slightest idea as to what it actually means. A state which faithfully implements 'Rabbaniyat' in individual and collective life of the citizens is an Islamic State. Today, there is nowhere in the world a living Islamic social organism"". (Abul Hashim, In Retrospection (Subarna Publishers, Dhaka, 1974, pp. 40–41)

Ordinary people seem to be caught in an unrelenting cycle of rising prices for essential goods. Various reports have recently highlighted the continued rise in the prices of essentials, especially food, causing immense hardship for low- and fixed-income households but also shocks for many who expected a change. Evidently, events of the past few months—the mass uprising and political changeover in July-August, followed by unprecedented rainfall and flash floods in August-September—have hadsignificant impactson the production and supply of most food staples. However, there are indications ofartificial price inflationas well.
Reportedly, vegetable prices have risen by Tk 20-40 per kg, while broiler chicken now costs Tk 20 more. The price of a dozen brown eggs has surged by Tk 15, with a total increase of Tk 20-25 per dozen in justthree weeks(as of October 5). Prices of green chilies have skyrocketed by Tk 60 in just one week. Soybean oil prices have gone up by Tk 5-10, and palm oil by Tk 15. While extreme weather and global factors have undoubtedly affected production and supply chains, they don't fully explain the scale of these price hikes.
Reports also suggest the involvement of market syndication. Large corporate entities are allegedlycontrolling the market as always, manipulating the prices of essentials—a familiar situation from the tenure of the previous government which did little to break the syndicates. But their continued operation now has prompted many to ask: what is the current administration doing about it?
Since taking office on August 8, the interim government has initiated several key reform initiatives across different sectors. However, there have been nosignificant measuresaimed at controlling the kitchen market and providing some relief to struggling citizens. While steps such as making onions and potatoes duty-free did help lower their prices, and attempts were made to fix the prices of eggs and chicken, these efforts havelargely been ineffective. On Monday, Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Mahmud announced the imminent formation of atask forceto monitor markets and rein in the soaring prices of essentials. While this is a welcome step, much more needs to be done. With people's purchasing power remaining generally stagnant, any further increase or instability in prices will only deepen the burden on already vulnerable households.
The interim government, therefore, must prioritise a comprehensive plan to address the price issue. This may include temporary initiatives such as increasing the imports of essential items and making more items duty-free to increase their supply, and also reducing fuel prices so that the transportation cost drops. But more importantly, the administration must make it a priority to free the market of the influence of syndicates and extortion so that there is zero scope for manipulating the prices.

In his influential bookDevelopment as Freedom, Nobel laureate in economics Amartya Sen argues that genuine freedom is achieved through comprehensive development rather than mere economic growth. He challenges the view that GDP alone can measure development, asserting that real progress is marked by access to essential services like education, healthcare, and transportation, as well as fundamental rights such as voting and freedom of expression. Sen uses Singapore as a case in point, demonstrating that economic advancement does not necessarily equate to freedom of speech or democratic rights.
The debate in Bangladesh over whether constitutional changes are required to ensure development and freedom is a pressing one. There is an assumption that without rewriting the constitution, it might be difficult to safeguard voting and other rights, and that autocracy could return in some form in future. Let's assume that we rewrite the constitution to ensure democracy in Bangladesh and strengthen the judiciary, administrative bodies, law enforcement, and the election commission. We might even alter the way parliament operates to prevent political domination by any single individual. In theory, this could provide comfort that political or elite influence on democratic institutions could be reduced.
However, this might be considered a straw man argument in the context of Bangladesh's political landscape. By straw man, I refer to a fallacy that distorts or oversimplifies an established or meritorious idea to oppose it. For instance, the existing constitution might work effectively even if some argue that changes or a rewrite are necessary. In this context, I argue that advocating for constitutional rewriting is a straw man argument because predicting how any government might turn autocratic again, despite having an ideally crafted constitution, is inherently uncertain. There is no perfect constitutional solution to safeguard democracy. Democracy relies not only on the constitution but also on political culture, education, public awareness, and a collective commitment to democratic principles.
Dr BR Ambedkar, world-renowned writer of the Indian Constitution, expressed this idea clearly in his 1949 Constituent Assembly speech given in the Indian parliament: ""…I shall not therefore enter into the merits of the constitution. Because I feel, however good a constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. The working of a constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the constitution. The constitution can provide only the organs of state such as the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of the state depend are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics.""
Unless politicians break free from monopolistic or authoritarian attitudes, changing the constitution would not prevent future regimes from prioritising corporate interests over public welfare. Many politicians enter politics with the sole expectation of advancing their own business interests by manipulating the existing system.Even in the US and the UK, systems designed to limit political interference in judicial and administrative processes ultimately depend on the democratic choices of those in power. For example, the UK does not have a single written constitution, while the US Constitution, despite recent calls for its significant reform, has largely remained intact. In both countries, the strength of basic institutions—such as electoral institutions, judiciary, the law enforcement agencies—ensures democratic stability. While none of these institutions are perfect, they function effectively enough to ensure democracy in the US and the UK. Despite the generally effective functioning of democratic institutions in both countries, concerns about poor governance and cronyism have emerged as significant factors that critics argue may have contributed to loss of the Conservatives in the 2024 election to the Labour Party.Thus, my argument against attempts at constitutional rewriting in a country like Bangladesh is twofold. First, within neoliberalism, any state following capitalist structures cannot guarantee that the government will refrain from infringing on public interests. Governments aligned with corporate interests always would find ways to undermine even the most robust institutions, whether protected by the best possible constitution (e.g., the US) or lacking a single written constitution (e.g., the UK). For instance, when former US President Donald Trump attempted to influence vote counts in the 2020 presidential election, it was the integrity of electoral officials that prevented him from succeeding. Had these officials been dishonest, the outcome might have been different. In the UK, the electoral commission is fiercely independent, ensuring that the best procedures and standards are followed without compromise.Read moreProposals for a balanced governmentSecond, unless politicians break free from monopolistic or authoritarian attitudes, changing the constitution would not prevent future regimes from prioritising corporate interests over public welfare.

The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has invited three major conglomerates—Meghna Group, City Group, and PHP Group—to list their companies on the stock exchanges, aiming to provide good stocks for investors.
The BSEC held a meeting on October 7 at its headquarters in the capital, where Mostafa Kamal, chairman and managing director of Meghna Group of Industries; Md Hasan, managing director of City Group, and Mohammed Akther Parvez, director of PHP Group, were present.
The BSEC said it will continue to invite fundamentally-strong companies to enhance the quality of the stock market, according to a press release issued today.
""The inclusion of such companies is expected to improve investor confidence by providing a broader selection of reliable stocks,"" said the stock market regulator.
""These three groups have made significant contributions to the economy, with diverse business operations across several sectors,"" said BSEC Chairman Khondoker Rashed Maqsood.
He added that listing fundamentally-strong companies would offer investors access to a wider range of quality stocks.
BSEC Commissioners Md Mohsin Chowdhury, Md Ali Akbar, and Farzana Lalarukh were also present at the meeting.

GPH Ispat, one of the leading steel manufacturers in the country, posted Tk 85.64 crore in net profit for the fiscal year ending on June 30 this year.
The profit is 205 percent higher than the previous year and highest in 15 years.
The improved profitability is largely attributed to the company's effective management of foreign currency exchange losses, GPH said in its disclosure posted on the website of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) today.
The company's earnings per share was Tk 1.77 in FY24, a significant increase from Tk 0.58 the previous year.
""In FY24, GPH Ispat's total foreign currency losses amounted to Tk 79.31 crore, down from Tk 232.5 crore in FY23,"" said the steel manufacturer.
The substantial reduction in foreign currency losses led to a decrease in finance costs by Tk 51.54 crore and a drop in current tax expenses by Tk 6.66 crore for GPH, boosting net profit by Tk 59.01 crore year-on-year.
The company pointed out that while operating profit remained steady compared to last year, its strategic financial management was pivotal in boosting earnings.
Additionally, the company reported net operating cash flow per share (NOCFPS) of Tk 9.89, compared to Tk 2.94 in FY2023.
""Payment against suppliers and other obligations was less than customer collections, resulting in positive NOCFPS,"" said GPH.
The board of GPH recommended a 10 percent cash dividend for FY24, the highest amount since 2021.
In another disclosure on the DSE, GPH Ispat has announced plans to issue non-convertible, cumulative, redeemable, and non-participative preference shares amounting to Tk 500 crore, aimed at refinancing existing loans, pending approval from the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission.
Shares of GPH Ispat surged 7.44 percent to Tk 26 on the DSE today.
The company, which started commercial production in 2008, remains one of Bangladesh's leading integrated steel manufacturers, focusing on MS Billet and MS Rod production.

Swedish retail giant H&M Group has partnered with Chorka Textile Ltd in Bangladesh to pilot new technologies to significantly reduce water, energy and chemical consumption in textile production.
The initiative involves European Plan Zero members Revozona AG, Imogo AB, and Pluvia, whose technologies will be assessed together for the first time under one roof, according to a statement from H&M.
The goal is to evaluate the combined potential of these technologies to make production processes more sustainable.
This partnership is crucial for finding scalable climate solutions, according to Ziaur Rahman, country manager of H&M Bangladesh.
He said the partnership supports the multinational retail brand's goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 56 percent and reducing freshwater extraction and consumption by 30 percent across its supply chain by 2030.
Rahman said electrification is key to systemic solutions in the industry, but it requires a reliable grid infrastructure. Engaging stakeholders is essential to ensure the success of such transitions, he added.
Gérard J. Peters, global coordinator of Plan Zero, described the initiative as a catalyst for sustainable transformation in the textile sector.
He noted that combining innovative technologies will help reduce environmental impacts and align fashion with sustainability.
Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, Chairman & CEO of Pran RFL Group, which owns Chorka Textile, highlighted that environmental concerns are vital in densely populated Bangladesh.
He affirmed that partnering with H&M would allow both companies to implement global best practices in sustainability, benefiting not only Bangladesh but the world.

The uphill battle to restore confidence among the business community is progressing slowly as the Prof Muhammad Yunus-led interim government marks its second month in office.
Businesspeople, who now adopt a ""wait-and-see"" approach, say they are worried but still optimistic that the situation will improve soon. Meanwhile, business expansion, foreign direct investment (FDI) and new local investment plans remain on hold.
After weeks of fierce nationwide protests and mass uprisings, the Awami League government was ousted on August 5. Subsequently, the interim government led by Nobel laureate Yunus was sworn in on August 8.
The new government inherited at least half a dozen business challenges, such as corruption, persistent high inflation, gas and power crises, dollar shortages and a sharp depreciation of the taka.
Businesspeople, who now adopt a ""wait-and-see"" approach, say they are worried but still optimistic that the situation will improve soonThese challenges already translated into declining FDIs, slumping capital machinery and raw material imports, according to official data.Even before the new government could begin confidence restoration work, widespread labour unrest, deteriorating law and order, arson, factory looting and the arrest of businesspeople added to the existing challenges.Read more2 months of interim govt: Hopes still persist""We expected a higher level of business confidence from the incumbent government,"" said AK Azad, chairman and managing director of Ha-Meem Group, a leading garment exporter.

A curious tale of two cases
CU to launch 'e-car' service on campus for students

The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has alleged that manipulators were fuelling protests against the regulator to prevent it from taking a stand against corruption and reforming the stock market.
The involvement of manipulators and an ""AGM Party"" was uncovered through an investigation, the BSEC said in a letter sent to the Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance on Sunday.
According to the BSEC, ""AGM Party"" are people who pass agendas at annual general meetings (AGM) of listed companies in order to take illegal benefits.
Protests have been staged outside the BSEC office in Agargaon and in Motijheel for more than a week.
These so-called investors came under the banner of the general investors but in reality they are not general investors, the BSEC said.
They are trying to destabilise the situation with their demands, most of which are illogical. They also raised questions regarding the companies that were sent to the Z category.
Recently, the stock exchanges demoted 27 companies to Z category from A and B categories as they failed to pay dividends properly.
The BSEC said its mandate is only to monitor whether the rules and regulations were followed in demoting the companies. Its job is not to look after the indices but to ensure accountability and transparency.
Since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government on August 5, the DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), has fallen by 283 points, or 5 percent, to 5,335 points till yesterday.
There is an official process to submit demands and the regulator should have been given proper time to scrutinise those, the letter said.
However, they placed their demands in the media and urged for the resignation of the BSEC chairman. After that, they came to the BSEC office and locked its gate.
It indicates that some people are being used in order to stop the BSEC's reform activities, it said.
To maintain transparency and accountability, the regulator must take punitive steps which may not satisfy everyone, the letter read.
""Clearly, the activities of the undisciplined people are ill-motivated.
""The BSEC found in its investigation and analysis that the AGM Party and some people involved in a lot of corruption are against punitive actions and reforms, so they are fuelling the protests.""
They fear that their manipulation will be stopped if all reform activities are carried out, it said.
In order to gauge the present situation of the stock market, the BSEC said the new commission met with several stakeholders to unearth problems and ways out.
It has already formed several investigation committees to reveal corruption and manipulation in the past 15 years.
The last commission hardly took legal steps against manipulators, but the present one has taken proper legal action against delinquents.
Last week, the BSEC imposed a record fine of Tk 428.52 crore on 9 individuals and firms for manipulating the stocks of Beximco Ltd.
Three audit firms were removed from the BSEC's audit panel as they failed to enlist in the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).
It also cancelled the bond issuance of several banks as they failed to fulfil all the conditions and cancelled the share issuance of several companies for non-compliance, the BSEC said.
The regulator is going to take steps against companies that failed to provide announced dividends timely.
At the same time, it has taken steps against brokerage house owners who misused investor funds.
The BSEC fined 25 individuals and firms for their involvement in corruption and froze around 60 beneficiary owners' accounts of potential manipulators.
It is investigating the manipulation of 24 companies' stocks and the misuse of several mutual funds.
Ataullah Naim, president of the Bangladesh Capital Market Investors United Association, told The Daily Star they have not staged any protests on the road.
""We have only placed our demands in a press briefing. We do not know who is protesting in front of the BSEC or whose purpose they are serving.""
The commission said in the letter that the protesting investors came in front of the BSEC under the banner of 'Puji Bazaar Biniog Kari Oikko Porishod'.
Most of their investors are demanding the resignation of the BSEC chairman.

Nike's ongoing struggles are giving Adidas a chance to keep taking market share from its larger US rival, but the German brand will have to work harder to keep shoppers interested in its key Samba and Gazelle terrace sneakers.
The shoes have boosted Adidas sales over the past year, and analysts expect it to report third-quarter revenues of 6.4 billion euros, a 10% increase on a year ago in currency-adjusted terms, when it reports earnings on Oct. 29.
But, more than a year into the trend, the Samba won't remain the ""it shoe"" for much longer, industry experts say.
""The sneakerheads, the more fashion-forward consumer, they already have the shoes. We're now looking at them (Adidas) milking the rest of the trend on the way down by introducing lower price points within terrace,"" said Aneesha Sherman, analyst at Bernstein.
""They can still get a tonne of growth out of that because there are still laggards who don't have these shoes yet or maybe didn't want to pay the $100 price point but are willing to pay a $60 price point,"" she added.
In a bid to attract shoppers who want to buy into the trend but still want to feel unique, Adidas has kept churning out new colourways for the Samba, Gazelle and Spezial, with some models featuring tongues like football boots, and contrast stripes in new materials like velvet.
That has kept third-party retailers like JD Sports JD.L happy for now. At half-year results on July 31, Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden said the brand was still ""chasing demand"" from retailers.
""There's always this push and pull, the consumer wants more, retailers want more, but the brand has to step back and say we're going to dial this back to make sure we preserve it for a long time,"" said Matt Powell, sneaker industry expert and senior advisor at BCE Consulting.
""Adidas would be right to really tap the brakes on the Samba and Gazelle, to make sure they promote the sell-through,"" he said. Sell-through refers to the percentage of product a retailer sells after receiving it from a supplier.
There are signs the brand's focus is shifting onto other shoes like the Campus and the SL72 ""retro running"" sneaker, while Stella McCartney's Paris Fashion Week show featured a new Adidas shoe modelled on motorsport racing shoes, tapping into the growing trend around Formula 1, which last week announced a 10-year partnership with luxury group LVMH.
Adidas can also no longer rely on strong revenues and profits from its remaining stock of Yeezy sneakers, as demand for the shoes designed by disgraced rapper Kanye West has fallen. In August, an Adidas mail to its sneaker club members advertised discounts of up to 70% on Yeezys.
Still, with Nike withdrawing its annual guidance and signalling a weak holiday trading season as a new CEO takes the helm, Adidas has a unique opportunity to grow, especially in the U.S. where Nike is especially dominant and Adidas was highly reliant on its Yeezy range.
In Europe, Adidas has taken market share over the past year while Nike's share has fallen, according to direct to consumer sales data from Consumer Edge which also shows significant gains by On Running, Puma, and Hoka.
Bernstein's Sherman expects Adidas to keep gaining share for the next year, as it will take time for Nike to turn its performance around.
""It could change, if Nike were to put out a strong lifestyle shoe in the spring, and if that were to catch and gain some traction in the summer, we could see a shift - where the it shoes of summer 2024 were the Samba and Gazelle, the it shoe of next summer could be something from Nike,"" she said.

Bangladesh have played 177 T20Is and Mahmudullah Riyad has been part of 140 of them. The veteran cricketer is now expected to announce a decision to bring the curtain down on his T20I career.
Riyad is set to make an announcement, which could even be due in today's pre-match press conference ahead of the second T20I against India and according to a source, Riyad is set to close the gate on his T20I career.
""It's not a break, he wants to bring an end to the T20I chapter. He is supposed to announce it in this series,"" a BCB official told The Daily Star.
While the suggestions are that he may come to the press conference today, it could not be determined whether he would make that announcement.
Sources have revealed that he had already communicated his desires to leave the format before the series.
It was skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto, who had talked about a new approach from this series before the first T20I in Gwalior.
""From this series, you will see our players trying to play with a new approach,"" he had said.
Since many of the younger players are coming through in this India series, Mahmudullah Riyad's place in it was questioned. Shanto's reply suggested that Riyad had been pondering an eventuality to his T20I career.
""This is a very important series for him [Mahmudullah] and maybe he will be in talks with the selectors, I am not too clear on that. But I feel that obviously there will be a discussion with the selectors and the board.""
That it was an important series, as Shanto said, would merit the return question from the media.
Was this Riyad's last T20I series?
""We haven't gone into any discussions about it. Going forward, let's see if it [discussion] happens. I don't want to get into this discussion before the start of a series,"" Shanto had said.
The speculations had already been there after Shanto's press conference. Riyad's performances in the last T20I World Cup was criticised, especially in light of his approach.
Riyad had retired from Tests in 2021.

T20 cricket is big in India and IPL, India's T20 franchise league, is the most-successful around the world. Yet, India are a scary good Test team just because of its pool of players and because the seriousness around Test cricket has been ingrained. Even the IPL, the biggest of brands, is used to filter money through to states to develop Test cricket.
In Gwalior, there are state association academies that are all integrated to the entire cricket structure of Madhya Pradesh.
Madhya Pradesh has 52 divisions which are divided among 10 revenue boards. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) ensures that cricket is played to the maximum and all revenue boards have their own grounds, with at least two dressing rooms being the bare minimum available.
The Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) runs from Indore and even during the first T20I between Bangladesh and India in Gwalior, members from Indore -- one of MP's revenue boards -- were present to oversee proceedings.
BCCI tournaments run through September till March and MPCA begins its tournament from November onwards, in line with BCCI. The MPCA calendar itself has nine tournaments such as M.Y. Memorial Trophy, Madhavrao Scidia Trophy or J.N Bhaya Trophy, which is played in T20 format. There is no secret recipe here for creating talents.
Kuldeep Sen, who made his name in the 2022 IPL or the likes of Avesh Khan and Rajat Patidar and Venkatesh Iyer are players who have come through the MPCA grind. There is a central academy in Indore and the academies in revenue boards directly report to the central academy.
India's cricket structure was not always so organised. What changed in the last decade?
""We are giving enough opportunities at grassroots level. BCCI is conducting U-16, U-19, U-22 and senior tournaments. So we go through our own tournaments on the same lines. Camps are regularly held in academies so players get chance to improve. The coaching staff move across the revenue boards to seek talent,"" Sanjiv Rao, secretary at MPCA, told The Daily Star.
""Camps are held at revenue boards for district players and also players from the headquarters [Indore]. In each age-category, we have 30-40 probables who are sent to central academy for camps. From the basis of camps and tournaments throughout the year, the final 20 are selected in age category for the state team, in this case the MPCA,"" he added.
There is huge competition for places. One BCCI official informed that some 30,000 players filter through the system in MPCA alone. Even players who have crossed U-22 level remain in focus if they have not made state team as they get to play in inter-divisional tournaments.
But for the BCCI, red-ball cricket takes precedence. IPL generates huge interest in the country for youngsters and the BCCI steers them first through red-ball doctrine.
""Red-ball requires hard work and patience. Youngsters are more inclined towards white-ball cricket. But we have a rule here. Until U-19 levels, we do not allow them to play T20 cricket. We want to create that base of technically correct red-ball players. So in U-19, we have fifty-over tournament but not T20s,"" Sanjiv said.
So the next time one looks at a perfectly-aligned head position in congruence with fluent bat speed from an Indian star in a T20I game, it is being developed through red-ball hurdle.
BCCI officials informed that even money from IPL, such as 40,000 crore INR in broadcast rights, filter through to state associations to develop the base. Building infrastructure has not been a problem as BCCI provides associations with at least 50 crore INR per year for maintenance and new infrastructure. Thus selectors, coaches and a huge pool of players make India a huge machinery for producing top-notch cricketers.

New Zealand know all about the challenge that awaits them in Sharjah on Tuesday at the ICC Women's T20 World Cup, when they will take on the reigning champions Australia.
The White Ferns started their tournament with a bang, beating India to set up the prospect of qualifying for the knockout stages from a highly competitive Group A.
But second up for the Kiwis is a match against their neighbours Australia, who beat them 3-0 in a T20I series in the run-in to the tournament.
""We've played them a lot over the years, not so much recently, but I thought we competed pretty well in those games,"" Suzie Bates said in her press conference the day before the game.
""And after the start we've had at this tournament, I think if we can put that performance that we put together against India, against Australia, we're going to go really well. So, we're just really excited.
""I think, to start this tournament on that positive note and to have Australia next up we've got two pretty tough games first up and we're feeling really good about where we are at.
""Those games that happened before don't really matter in a World Cup, but we know them really well in terms of our planning and preparation.""
There will be plenty of familiarity between the two sides, although Bates did say that the recent series loss won't give the teams all of the information they need, partially due to the contrasting conditions.
""I think we were still sort of figuring out our best 11 and the makeup of the team and obviously conditions there versus here, spinners versus seam, the balance of the team is slightly different.
""But look, we probably didn't show all our cards and they probably didn't show all their cards, but at the end of the day, when the teams have already played a game, you kind of know what you're probably going to be up against and it's really about the balance of seam and spin.
""We know them so well, we play a lot with and against them in other leagues, so there's going to be no surprises. It's just who can, I guess, put that performance together.""
And Australia's Sophie Molineux agreed that it will be a very different challenge to the recent series, particularly given New Zealand showed outstanding form in the opening game against India.
""Obviously they played out of their skin and really attacked the Indian team.
""I think it won't be too dissimilar to how we approach every game and that's to come out with intensity, and obviously the conditions are very different to where we played them back in Australia.
""But again, it's just adapting and yeah, they've obviously had a really good win so they're going to come in on a high and hopefully we can carry on our momentum as well.""

More than 11 million fans have flocked to Major League Soccer games this season, the league said Monday, breaking the previous record of 10.9 millions fans who attended games in 2024.
The league said in a statement that the league has averaged 23,240 fans per game, breaking the 11 million-fan barrier for the first time in history.
MLS said the arrival of international stars such as Lionel Messi -- whose presence in the league has often prompted teams to switch fixtures to bigger stadiums -- had helped boost attendances.
""The arrival of international stars and the work from clubs to create more unique fan friendly ticket packages and game day experiences are among the key drivers of the continued surge of record-breaking attendance across MLS,"" the league announced.
The record-breaking tally comes with the regular season still to be completed. Sixteen more matches are due to ake place before the season wraps up on October 19.
The attendance numbers mark the third consecutive year that MLS had drawn more than 10 million fans.

Ireland captain Paul Stirling led from the front with a dashing 88 as his side completed their ODI series against South Africa with a convincing 69-run win in the final match in Abu Dhabi on Monday.
Chasing 285 to win, South Africa slipped to 126-6 with only a fine 91 from Jason Smith keeping them in the game.
But Smith was unable to prevent the Irish from claiming only their second ODI win over the Proteas.
""It's a relief to get past it,"" said Stirling.
""We talked about just winning the game and getting the job done. We let ourselves down in the first two games. We knew if we applied ourselves and kept our wickets in hand we'll get the runs.""
Graham Hume, who was born in Johannesburg and played for South Africa Under 19s, was the pick of the Irish bowlers with 3-29 while Ulster-born Craig Young finished with 3-40.
South Africa took the ODI series 2-1 with the two sides sharing the preceding T20 series 1-1.
Stirling set the tone for Ireland's 284-9 after he won the toss and decided to bat.
That was in contrast to the first two matches when Ireland chased, failing to survive past 32 overs as they made 132 and 169 in reply to big South African scores.
On Monday, Stirling and Andy Balbirnie put on 101 for the first wicket before Balbirnie fell to Lizaad Williams for a steady 45 from 73 balls.
Curtis Campher accelerated with 34 off 36 balls before he fell to Ottneil Baartman who then bowled Stirling in his next over. The captain had hit three sixes and eight fours in his innings.
Harry Tector kept Ireland moving with a 48-ball 60 while Williams, the only South African bowler to get through his full 10 overs, finished with 4-56.
South Africa's reply was soon in disarray at 10-3 as Mark Adair removed Ryan Rickelton and Rassie van der Dussen, standing in for injured captain Temba Bavuma. Reeza Hendricks edged Graham Hume to Balbirnie at second slip.
Kyle Verreynne (38) and Tristan Stubbs (20) steadied the innings with a 49-run partnership but once Verreynne was leg before to Young the wheels came off again.
At 126-6 South Africa looked out of it but Smith made sure the Irish would have to wait.
The 29-year-old from Western Province, who made nought in his only other ODI against Afghanistan last month, made the most of his chance after being drafted in following Wiaan Mulder returned home for personal reasons.
Smith hammered his 91 from 93 balls with nine fours and four sixes before slicing Hume to Adair at third man.

Let's begin this rant, disguised as a write-up on the sorry state of the Bangladesh men's T20I team, with a question: Guess which of the following three statements was made by captain Najmul Hossain Shanto after the seven-wicket defeat against India in the first T20I in Gwalior on Sunday.
Statement A: ""When you have these sorts of performances, it is hard to say much. There are a lot of areas we have to look at, especially our batting.""
Statement B: ""We didn't bat well... It was a good surface, we should've scored at least 175. You must ask the other batsmen why they didn't bat well. I can't answer for everyone. As I said, nothing worked out today. Whatever we did, it didn't click.""
Statement C: ""I wouldn't say it [the team's brand of cricket] is getting worse. I think we are a better team than this. We have not been doing well in this format for some time now. But I don't believe we are this bad as a team.""
If one chose option C, it was a wise decision. But even in thinking option A or B was the right answer, one can hardly be blamed.
The first statement belongs to former captain Mahmudullah Riyad, who said this after the Tigers got bundled out for a mere 73 against Australia in their final match of the ICC T20 World Cup 2021, which the Aussies chased down in just 6.2 overs.
The second quote came from Shakib Al Hasan, another former skipper, who in his typically blunt style vented his frustration after the team got bundled out for just 129 in Sylhet against the West Indies back in 2018, a total the visitors chased down with 9.1 overs to spare.
With these three statements spanning across six years, the three captains attempted to do the same thing -- explain how the Tigers got all out in a T20I game for a total way below par on a wicket that obviously had more runs on offer.
In the last six years, captains have come and gone, players have been swapped and changed, multiple coaches have had a crack, and buzzwords like 'Bangladeshi brand of T20' and 'impact cricket' have been thrown around. But just as these statements indicate, Bangladesh's fate in T20Is has more or less remained the same.
Now, one could accuse this line of argument of cherry-picking only the worst cases to prove a point, not showing the complete picture, of being vindictive and not backed by actual data.
Luckily, when it comes to showing how far behind Bangladesh are in batting in T20Is, there is no shortage of stats.
Since 2018, Bangladesh's average runs per over in T20Is stand at 7.45, the worst among all Test-playing nations. This picture becomes even more harrowing when associate members are brought into the mix.
The ICC granted T20I status to all its members in 2018, and all men's T20s between associate nations since January 2019 have been granted international status.
Out of the 104 T20I teams, Bangladesh rank 40th in terms of run rate since 2018, sandwiched between Kenya (7.49) and Tanzania (7.44). Even teams like Malaysia (7.90), Spain (7.71) and Bulgaria (7.64) are ahead of Bangladesh.
When it comes to scoring over 200 in an innings, Bangladesh are tied with Ireland and Sri Lanka at the second-last spot among the full members, with six such innings each.
The picture only gets gloomier when looking at individual stats. Among players who have made at least 1,000 runs in T20Is since January 2018, Liton Das' strike rate of 125.34 is the best among all Bangladeshi batters.
But when comparing with all other batters who have played T20Is in this period and have made at least 1,000 runs, Liton is languishing way down at 75th.
Bangladesh have three other representatives in the top 100 – Shakib (121.16) at 89th, Afif Hossain (119.63) at 95th, and Mahmudullah (118.93) at 96th.
The easiest explanation for Bangladesh's poor batting in the shortest format -- one that gets thrown around quite frequently, and was even used by Shanto yesterday after the first T20I -- is the low and slow nature of wickets back at home, which leaves players ill-prepared on how to bat on flat surfaces where 200 is a par score.
If unfamiliarity with flat wickets is a handicap for Bangladesh in doing well in T20Is on batting-friendly tracks, by that logic, the Tigers should thrive on home surfaces where run-scoring is more challenging.
But looking at the win-loss ratio in home T20Is, Bangladesh rank seventh among the 12 Test nations, among which Afghanistan have never even played a home game.
When coming across difficult batting surfaces away from home, time and again, Bangladesh batters have come up short in T20Is.
For example, right before this year's T20 World Cup, Bangladesh were hit with a couple of shock defeats against co-hosts USA -- an associate side -- on pitches that were not easy to score on.
In that tournament, Bangladesh overcame Sri Lanka in the opener in a low-scoring thriller, came agonisingly close to defeating eventual finalists South Africa, and made it to the Super Eights.
But they ended the tournament with an awful display against Afghanistan in a virtual quarterfinal, where they gave up on trying to win by a margin that would take them to their maiden semifinal, chose to go for a meaningless victory instead, and then failed to accomplish even that.
So, the stats clearly indicate that when it comes to scoring runs quickly in T20Is, Bangladesh are nowhere near the best. Even in home conditions, the Tigers are middle of the pack in terms of results.
The team struggles to score big on batting surfaces, does not fare too well on tough wickets away from home either, and the display against Afghanistan in the T20 World Cup showed that this team, at least the think tank, does not have the courage to dream big.
Now, giving credit where credit is due, the Bangladesh batters, probably encouraged by the management, did make a genuine effort to show positive intent against India.
Liton took the aerial route in just the second ball he faced, Towhid Hridoy took on the long-on fielder right after the Powerplay, and Mahmudullah charged down the wicket in the first ball he faced against India's quickest pacer, Mayank Yadav.
The problem was, all three of them miscued their shots in different ways and got caught. Having a positive intent is all well and good, but without skill and match awareness, it is of no use.
Coming back to Shanto, hearing the skipper say, ""I don't believe we are this bad as a team,"" in reply to the very first question at the post-match press conference, it seemed like he was stuck in the first stage of grief, which is denial.
But in about a minute, Shanto seemingly skipped the next three phases -- anger, bargaining and depression -- and jumped to the final stage, acceptance, when he admitted that the inexperienced Indian team they were up against outclassed them in both ""skill"" and ""mentality"".
Hopefully, this acceptance would lead the team management to stop sounding like a broken record, presenting the same excuses after embarrassing defeats, and come up with plans on how to improve the skill level and mentality of the players in T20Is.

A tipping point has seemingly been reached in world football's increasingly hectic schedule, as evidenced by the several high-profile injuries in recent weeks leading up to the latest FIFA window.
In a cruel twist of fate, Manchester City midfielder Rodri, who cautioned the players about going on strike due to intense workloads in mid-September, was sidelined for the rest of the 2024-25 season following an ACL injury a week later.
""I think we are close to that [striking],"" Rodri said when asked if it is possible players will strike. ""If you ask any player, they will say the same. It's the general opinion of the players.
""If it keeps going this way, there will be a moment where we have no other option, but let's see. It's something that worries us because we are the ones who suffer,"" said the Spaniard.
City went deep into most of the competitions they played last season, with a few of their players recording over 70 appearances. English midfielder Phil Foden was included in 77 matchday squads, making 72 appearances, while City's former Argentinian striker Julian Alvarez was included in 83 matchday squads, leading to 75 appearances, including appearances in the European Championships and Copa America duties, respectively.
Real Madrid's Dani Carvajal was the latest key figure who suffered a season-ending ACL injury. Carvajal, who was named in 55 matchday squads, played in 49 matches last season for club and country.
""It's impossible to be at full capacity with 72 plus games. I think the appropriate bodies should analyse this because it's practically impossible. The quality of the game drops, and we suffer, along with our families,"" the 32-year-old said.
This season several players could play as many as 80 games due to the expanded Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup formats, alongside enlarged national team competitions.
The USA will host the first edition of FIFA's new 32-team Club World Cup from June 15 to July 13 next year after the end of the club football season.
""Nobody wants to play in it, nobody is excited about it,"" former England international Jaime Carragher told CBS recently. ""The best players in the world are being treated like cattle,"" he added.
The call for safeguarding players is nothing new, particularly in the English Premier League where there is no winter break; rather, the players are faced with a packed festive season.
The effects of packed fixtures are, however, becoming far more prevalent, as evidenced by all these season-ending injuries.
Most clubs do not have the luxury of having a star-studded squad, laced with top-quality squad players -- a delight for coaches who could rotate without having to compromise much with on-field quality. This makes it even more difficult for clubs with budget constraints, as it places them under pressure to avoid rotation and play the same group of players week in and week out, putting them at greater risk of injury.
Such workloads also come at a great risk for the younger players.
For instance, Barcelona's Spanish midfielder Pedri made 75 appearances for club and country in 2020-21 and struggled with muscular injuries in the subsequent seasons. His clubmate and Spain's latest young sensation, Lamine Yamal, played in 64 matches for club and country last season, followed by his side's triumphant run in the Euros.
As things stand, the pressures of increased workloads have certainly been building up among the players, and it seems to be a matter of time before calls for consideration turn into a full-on strike.

In a bombshell press conference on Thursday, Bangladesh ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan said that he had informed the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) that the upcoming South Africa Test series at home in October-November will be the last Test series of his career.
Following the fall of the Awami League government, of which he was an MP, Shakib has not returned to the country. He feels that if he can head back to the country and leave on his own terms, he will play the series against South Africa, which is to be his last Test series.

It is not just Test cricket that Shakib is set to leave as he further informed that he will not be playing T20 format for the next few series as he feels it is time to move on from the format.

Asked if he would play the T20I series against India, starting on October 6, he informed that he feels he has already played his last T20I.
""I think I have played my last match at the World Cup [against Afghanistan],"" he added.
When asked if the Champions Trophy in 2025 would be his last foray in the ODI format, he simply said ""I hope so. Nine more ODIs.""

A Dhaka court today issued a travel ban on former Awami League lawmaker Tanveer Imam and his wife Mahin Imam over corruption allegations.
Judge Mohammed Ash-Shams Joglul Hossain of the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court passed the order after Anti-Corruption Commission's Deputy Director Joynul Abedin submitted an application in this regard.
ACC Public Prosecutor Mir Ahmed Ali Salam moved the application before the court on behalf of the ACC.
The deputy director, in the application, said the couple had amassed a huge amount of money through corruption and abuse of power.
Investigation revealed that the couple might flee the country. This will make further investigations difficult for the commission. Thus, a travel ban is necessary, the letter added.
Copies of the orders were sent to the special superintendent of police (immigration) of Special Branch for the next course of action.

Half a kilometre of the Ghighat area on the Kapasia regional road in Charsindur union of Gazipur has collapsed into the river, threatening at least 30 families in the nearby Ravidas neighbourhood.
The erosion, caused by continuous rainfall over the past week, has severely affected the area, reports our Gazipur correspondent.
The collapse occurred at 9:00am today, destroying portions of the Raniganj-Charsindur road and cutting off vital access routes.
Residents fear further destruction if immediate action is not taken.
Raihan Khan, sub-divisional engineer (Gazipur) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, confirmed the riverbank's collapse.
""We have received videos showing houses being destroyed. We will take action,"" he said, noting that a similar incident had occurred earlier along the same river, which had been temporarily blocked.
Parul Ravidas, vice president of the Ghighat Sangh Mitra Puja Mandap, expressed concern that without swift intervention, the homes of all 30 families, along with the Puja Mandap, could be washed away.
The situation has disrupted daily life.
Neepa Rani Das, a student at Nashera High School, said, ""I have stopped going to school. Many other students are in the same situation. With the road gone, there is no alternative way for us to attend classes.""
Mohammad Parag Ahmed, a local businessman from Raniganj Bazar, said that the road was critical for transporting goods from Narsingdi.
""The road has been closed since Saturday, and our business has come to a standstill,"" he added.
The residents also highlighted years of illegal sand extraction from the river, which they blame for weakening the riverbank and contributing to the collapse.
Ganesh Ravidas, a local resident, said, ""Our houses are being swallowed by the river. The bank has broken down by about 30 feet.""
Mafiza Akhter from Taraganj village, a widow, expressed her fear.
""If the river continues to erode, our crops, which are right on the riverbank, will be lost. How will we survive if we can't plant?""
Main Uddin, upazila engineer of Kapasia, said that local authorities have been informed.
""I visited the site, and higher authorities at LGED have been alerted. Necessary measures will be taken,"" he assured.

Two cases were filed over the killing of two men in the capital's Jatrabari during the mass uprising that toppled the Awami League government.
The killings took place on July 18 and 19 and the circumstances surrounding the crimes were different but the seven-page first information statements (FIRs) filed with Jatrabari Police Station are almost identical, with the names, addresses, and other details of the two victims being the only differences.
Abu Bakar, 55, who claims to be the convener of Ward 63 Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, filed both the cases on September 2 over the deaths of Sakib Hasan, 22, and Jahangir Alam, 50.
The same 442 individuals are accused in both cases.
Furthermore, Bakar, who is not related to either of the victims, filed the cases without informing the families. Grieving members of Sakib and Jahangir's families were surprised when they were informed of the cases.
Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, former ministers-- Obaidul Quader, Amir Hossain Amu, Hasan Mahmud, Asaduzzaman Khan, Dipu Moni, former inspectors general of police AKM Shahidul Hoque, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun are among the accused.
Most of the other accused are leaders and activists of the Awami League, particularly from the Jatrabari, Demra, and Kadamtali areas.
Veteran Supreme Court lawyer ZI Khan Panna said such cases would not stand the scrutiny of a trial and it would be impossible to ensure justice for the victims.
""These cases seem to be aimed at harassing people,"" he said, adding the FIR is crucial for proving a complaint and it must mention facts only.
Contacted, Jahangir's 18-year-old daughter Mithila Akter, a resident of Jatrabari, said, ""We lost our father. We should have been the ones filing the case.""
""Besides, the man sued several hundred people of our neighbourhood. Now these people hate us for no reason.""
She added that Bakar, who filed the case, ""definitely has ill motives. He has accused people he wants to harm"".
""I want justice for my father. We also want punishment of the man who filed the case without telling us.""
Sakib's father Mortoza Alam also said he was surprised when he heard about the case.
""Police shot my son dead. But the complaint is against political leaders and activists. ""I want justice. I will file a case with the International Crimes Tribunal soon. I will sue only those who shot my son.""
Contacted on September 23, Bakar said he filed the cases to ensure justice for the victims.
About the identical wording in both cases, he said he could not discuss the matter further. He requested a follow-up call, but had not responded to calls later.
Like the two identical cases, this newspaper also found three cases filed with Badda Police Station on August 20 and 21, over the killings of Sumon Sikder, 31, Hafizul Sikder, 28, and Sohag Mia, 30.
All the three cases contain almost similar narratives and same number of the accused though the victims were killed in three places at different times.
Masuma filed a murder case accusing 179 people over the death of her son Sumon on July 19 on Pragati Sarani in Uttar Badda while Abubakar Sikder filed another murder case accusing the same people over the death of his son Hafizul in Merul Badda area on July 20.
Bellal Mia, 35, filed the third one against 178 people over the death of his brother Sohag on Gulshan Link Road on August 5.
Though the place of murder and dates are different, the narratives of the cases are identical and 178 accused in each of the three cases are same.
Masuma could not be contacted but her husband Yousuf Sikder, a leader of the Badda BNP, said, ""We made them accused following suggestions from the party men.""
Another complainant named Abu Bakar said, ""I know that if too many people are accused, justice can elude us. But a local BNP leader in Badda gave a list of people to accuse. I just signed the papers.""
Bellal Mia said, ""I gave the names of the accused. I don't know how these names matched with the names of previous cases.""
Talebur Rahman, deputy commissioner (media) of DMP, said police are not harassing anyone for being sued in cases. Police submit an investigation report to the court after analysing evidence.
The Police Headquarters has recently ordered officers to drop the names of individuals against whom there was no evidence.

CU to launch 'e-car' service on campus for students
Gaza still bleeds
Chittagong University (CU) administration has decided to introduce an ""e-car"" service on its campus to alleviate transportation difficulties for students.
This announcement was made by the university's Pro-Vice Chancellor (administration), Professor Kamal Uddin, on Saturday evening.
He, however, did not mention the date for the launch of e-car service.
The possible routes for the vehicles are the university's Zero Point to the biology faculty and Zero Point to law faculty, campus sources said.
The vehicles will circulate the university like a circular bus and provide service within the campus, the sources said.
The students had been frequently demanding the introduction of a circular bus service to ease transportation difficulties.
But due to concerns about environmental pollution caused by old buses, the administration opted for the e-car service instead.
Professor Kamal Uddin said, ""Students have long requested a circular bus service on campus, but the existing buses are outdated. Using these old buses poses risks to the environment due to the fuel consumption involved.""
He further explained, ""Such environmental pollution is harmful for our green campus. Repairing the old buses and managing their fuel costs would require significant financial resources. Therefore, we are focusing on launching the e-car service.""

Gaza still bleeds
Intensified Israeli airstrikes on Gaza yesterday killed dozens on the eve of the first anniversary of its offensive in the besieged territory that has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians and left the enclave in ruins.
Israel's war on Gaza has since spread as it invaded Lebanon after months of trading fire across the border, raising the fear of a wider conflict in the Middle East with experts saying it risks sucking in major regional and world powers.
As the Israeli invasion enters its second year, tens of thousands of protesters marched in cities around the world calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, a prospect which experts say is unlikely anytime soon.
The marches were held in almost all major cities across Europe, Africa, Australia and the Americas demanding an end to the conflict.
In Washington, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated outside the White House, seeking that the United States, Israel's top military supplier, stop providing weapons and aid to Israel.
One man attempted to set himself on fire, AFP journalists saw, succeeding in lighting his left arm ablaze before bystanders and police extinguished the flames.
On October 7, 2023, Hamas-led fighters streamed across the border from Gaza into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping some 250 others, according to Israeli tallies.
The next day, Israel formally declared war on Hamas.
Since then, indiscriminate Israeli bombardment has damaged or destroyed two thirds of the total structures in the Gaza Strip, The United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) said on September 30. It also damaged or destroyed around 68 percent of cropland and roads.
Only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, and all suffer from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water.
According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza (more than 90 percent of the population) have been displaced, with many experiencing multiple forced displacements as a result of persistent Israeli relocation orders.
The blockade on humanitarian goods has caused a hunger crisis in the Palestinian enclave and led to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.
The offensive has not only destroyed the present day Gaza but also robbed its future as children, who make up almost half of Gaza's entire population, are the primary victims. Of the 42,000 killed in the enclave, at least 16,456 are children.
According to UN, none of them have been able to attend school since October 7. The longer fighting goes on, the greater the chance of losing an entire generation, it said.
The offensive intensified early yesterday with Israeli airstrikes hitting a mosque and a school sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip killing at least 26 people and wounding 93 others, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said.
Palestinian health officials said at least another 20 people had been killed since Saturday night in northern Gaza, after the army sent tanks into areas there for the first time in months and urged residents to leave.
The Israeli military said it had conducted ""precise strikes on Hamas terrorists"" who were operating within command and control centres embedded in Ibn Rushd School and the Shuhada al-Aqsa Mosque, in the area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.
Hamas rejects accusations it uses civilian facilities such as schools, hospitals and mosques for military purposes.
Amid the violence, the International Committee of the Red Cross urged all parties to ensure all civilians were protected.
""This is a year marked by heartbreak and unanswered questions. Families have been torn apart, with many loved ones still held against their will. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions have been displaced across the region,"" it said.
The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said Israel had struck 27 houses, schools and displacement shelters across Gaza in the past 48 hours.
Medics said an Israeli airstrike killed three Palestinians in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, where Israeli forces have been operating since May.
On Saturday, Israeli army issued new evacuation orders in parts of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, just north of Deir al-Balah, forcing hundreds of families to leave their houses. The military statement said its forces aimed to operate against Hamas fighters who waged attacks from the territory.
Meanwhile, Israeli tanks pushed into the northern Gaza areas of Beit Lahiya and Jabalia overnight, and planes hit several houses, killing at least 20 people, according to medics.
The Israeli military said its forces had encircled the area of Jabalia.
In one air strike, 10 people were killed in one house, and five others in another strike on a second home. Residents described it as one of the worst nights in many months.
""The war is back,"" said Raed, 52, from Jabalia, before he and his family left for Gaza City yesterday.
""Dozens of explosions from airstrikes and tank shelling shook the ground and buildings, it felt like the early days of the war,"" he told Reuters via a chat app.
The armed wings of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and smaller factions said fighters were engaged in gunbattles with Israeli forces in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps.
Palestinian and UN officials say no place in the enclave is safe, including the humanitarian zones.
Ahead of the anniversary, Israel placed its forces on alert.
Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a televised briefing: ""We are prepared with increased forces in anticipation for this day"", when there could be ""attacks on the home front"".
In Washington, US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said US will continue to pressure Israel and other players in the Middle East to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza even as advocates say that the United States has not thus far used its leverage over its ally.
Washington's occasional condemnation of Israel over the civilian death toll has mostly been verbal with no substantive change in policy.
President Joe Biden laid out a three-phase ceasefire plan for Gaza on May 31 but a deal between Israel and Hamas has not been reached due to gaps in exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and Israel's demand that it maintain presence in a corridor on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip bordering Egypt.
As the war in Gaza enters its second year and a wider Middle East conflict is on the verge of breaking out, one question remains: How, if it at all, does this end?
""I'm not sure that it does end,"" Mairav Zonszein, senior Israel-Palestine analyst for International Crisis Group, told the ABC.
""At this point, we can't talk just about the war in Gaza, but we have to talk about the war with Hezbollah, and the war in the West Bank … and of course Iran and its proxies.""
All of this makes the prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza even less likely, according to Zonszein.
""There's a spectrum,"" she said.
""It could get much, much worse on several fronts. They're all connected and the connecting theme … is Gaza.""

Eleven employees, including the manager of Banani Star Kabab and Restaurant, were arrested yesterday after allegedly assaulting a journalist of an online news portal.
The incident took place around 3:30pm, when Saleh Mohammad Rashid Alok, the executive editor of Politicsnews24.com, complained about the quality of food he was served.
Alok said he complained to the restaurant's manager about a foul smell in the kebab he was eating during lunch.
The manager, Md Muslim, dismissed the concern without inspecting the food, claiming the kebab was ""like that"".
As Alok shouted at the manager for his comment, the manager called the waiters by pressing the bell. The waiters attacked the journalist, leaving him injured.
Alok then sought medical treatment at Kurmitola General Hospital.
He filed a complaint with Banani Police Station, accusing 11 named individuals and several unidentified persons.
Sub-Inspector Mizanur Rahman, the investigation officer of the case, confirmed the arrest of 11 restaurant staff members, including the manager.
The arrestees are: Md Muslim, the manager; Kazi Md Sagar, Rasel, Mokhlesur, Ridoy Sarder, Apu Sarder, Hanif, Jamal Hossain, Mohon, Delwar Hossain, and Miraz Hawlader.
Mizanur said the arrested individuals will be presented before a Dhaka court later today.
""I was simply voicing my concern about the food, and instead of addressing it, they attacked me. I demand justice for what happened,"" Alok told The Daily Star.

The government has cancelled its deal with Summit Group on the second Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU).
The deal was terminated upon instruction from the power, energy, and mineral resources ministry, Petrobangla Chairman Zanendra Nath Sarker told The Daily Star yesterday.
Summit Group, in a statement, confirmed that it has received a termination notice of the FSRU's terminal use agreement.
""We believe this is unjustified and will appeal for review,"" it said, adding that the group has a proven track record of developing long-term infrastructure projects in Bangladesh in a responsible and transparent manner.
On March 30 this year, Petrobangla and Summit signed a terminal use agreement and another agreement for the implementation of its second FSRU.
On the same day, they also signed a sale and purchase agreement to supply 1.5 million tonnes of liquified natural gas (LNG) per year for a 15-year period, starting from October 2026.
Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) directed banks to freeze the accounts of Summit Group Chairman Muhammad Aziz Khan, his brothers, and other family members.
The BFIU, in a letter, instructed banks to block transactions for one month under the provisions of the money laundering prevention law.
The directive also applies to the bank accounts of the firms owned by the aforementioned individuals, freezing their transactions for the same period.
The anti-money laundering agency listed 11 individuals, including Muhammad Faruk Khan, former commerce minister, and Faisal Khan, president of the Bangladesh Independent Power Producers Association.
Summit Group, the largest private power producer in Bangladesh, is believed to have enjoyed various benefits and preferential treatment under the patronage of the previous Awami League government, which was ousted in a mass uprising in early August.
Following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, Summit and several other conglomerates have come under increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies, including the National Board of Revenue (NBR).
Recently, the NBR requested the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms to block share transfers by seven business houses, including Summit.
Summit also operates one of the two floating storage regasification units and supplies liquefied natural gas to the government.

It began as a simple protest: reform the government job quota system—a basic demand arising from a fundamental problem. Young people in Bangladesh are facing unprecedented levels of unemployment, whilereports from Februaryindicated that more than a quarter of the 1.9 million government job seats remained vacant. Adding fuel to the fire was a controversial high court verdict to restore the highly unpopular 56 percent job reservation system. Thus, you have the recipe for a massive nationwide student mobilisation demanding a solution to a broken system.
The answer to this growing unrest was simple. The government is no stranger to angry students on the streets. Whether that be the earlier road safety movement, the movement opposing VAT on private universities, or the previous movements against the quota, the answer was always the same—clear and non-antagonistic channels for dialogue. Who could have guessed that the government could fumble the ball so hard? Who would have imagined that such a simple demand would end up with the blood of hundreds on the streets?
After the internet ban was lifted, the images of horror that filled our social media feed seemed to be straight out of some war movie. Helicopters performing strafing runs, shooting sound grenades at crowds of people. Tanks rolling past burnt-out remains of vehicles. Security forces clearly using lethal weapons against unarmed protesters. And scores and scores of other atrocities, too numerous to list. Accounts and websites have been created solely to document and preserve these recorded atrocities. These resources are a mere Google search away for anyone who needs a quick, sobering dose of reality. At the time of writing, the number of dead isover 200, according to what some media outlets could verify. Who knows what the real count will turn out to be. But that is not all. Nearly five thousand have been arrested in over a week. Mothers and fathers helplessly roaming hospitals to find their missing children. Emotional eulogies of brothers and sisters who have been martyred in the violence. These are the images that will be burnt into the collective psyche of our nation. There will be no cover-up. We will not forget.
This monumental failure of the government to control the situation cannot simply be analysed as a monolith. If we peel back the surface of this failure, we see the incompetence, arrogance, and ineptitude unfurl like some kind of rotten onion. The first fumble was a remark by the prime minister, indirectly implicating all students asking for quota reforms as having some link with ""razakar"". The second fumble was the letting loose of the goons of student and youth wing of the ruling party, who then proceeded to turn a non-violent movement into one of needless violence. And the final fumble was the complete shutdown of the internet in Bangladesh, decimating Bangladesh's already faltering economy, as if to cut off the nose to spite the face.
There are many more layers to this chain of failures. Using tanks, vehicles, and helicopters—few of which were clearly marked with the UN logo—to subjugate the incensed masses. A complete failure to protect the nation's key point installations, such as the BTV building, metro rail station, and BRTA headquarters, etc. A comically weak attempt to convince the population that the internet shutdown was not a clear government overreaction. And a continuous and embarrassing disregard of our leaders for the bloody elephant in the room, which is the pile of dead bodies of our children, our best and brightest, who had to give their lives simply to earn the opportunity for a possible government job.
You know, I know, they know. This was a total and utter mess of an affair. Words simply fall short of describing its magnitude. It is such a mess that perhaps the government might even feel ashamed to admit it. Enemies are being invented out of thin air to justify using the military to quell the unrest. Perhaps if they try hard enough, they might even start to believe the narrative they are spewing. Whatever progressive image the ruling party had tried to build for itself over the last decade or so has been severely fractured. And once the layers of failure are peeled off to expose the rotten core, we are only left with two options: reckless ineptitude or malicious intent. These are the only two cards the government has to play.
There has been an ongoing trend of both the ruling party and the opposition to regard the government as some kind of omnipotent political entity capable of exercising incredible amounts of control over its population with the aid of foreign surveillance technology. Clearly, this has not worked. All it took to shut down Bangladesh's digital infrastructure was one building fire in the capital and a cut wire. Or perhaps the true mechanism of control was never sophisticated intelligence apparatus or assistance from foreign powers. The government has so far solved all its problems through force. Either through official institutions, the student political wing, or security forces in plain clothes, time after time, they have resorted to force their way out of all political hurdles.
However, the key strategic takeaway for the government from all of this should be to take a good, hard look at the means by which they have been ruling so far. Times are changing, and they may realise that the foundation of their rule is not as solid as they might have fooled themselves into believing so far. A closer inspection might reveal the true nature of their political entity. And this entity is now showing serious cracks.

As of Thursday, at least 156 people have died in six days' of violence, per the tally recorded by this daily. The exact number of deaths is unknown; there is no certainty if it will ever come to light. One state minister said, ""If law enforcement agencies come under attack, they will return fire. It is only natural that there would be some casualties.""
On July 16, we saw the cold-blooded killing of Abu Sayed, student of Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur and a coordinators of the quota reform movement, at the hands of police. A viral video of his final moments showed he was quite far from law enforcement. He posed no threat, yet the police member shot him. This does not match the government's narrative.
Within such a short period of time, an unprecedented level of bloodshed took place. This exceeded even the number of deaths during the nine years' of movement against Ershad's autocratic regime, the biggest movement in independent Bangladesh. That movement was violent too; it saw arson and vandalism, too.

Challenging that circular, some freedom fighters' children filed a writ, responding to which the High Court annulled it on June 5 this year, effectively reinstating the quota system. The government appealed against this decision on July 6. Not relying on the government, students of public universities began their movement again, and it was completely peaceful. On July 9, two students filed a petition, which led to the court issuing a stay order against the earlier verdict. In spite of the stay order, protests continued. The Appellate Division set the hearing date for July 21. In the meantime, several ministers made comments about the movement, such as the protesters were not following the law, they are defying the constitution, the issue must be resolved through court, the government will not bypass the court, etc. Some of those comments were condescending towards the protesters.

More than 50 BCL leaders resigned from their posts and aligned themselves with this movement. But the leadership and majority participation came from general students.

During the press conference on the same day, the PM asked, ""If the freedom fighters' grandchildren won't get quotas, should the grandchildren of Razakars [Pakistani collaborators] get quotas?""
In response, DU students brought out processions that night. They chanted loudly, ""Who are you, who am I? Razakar, Razakar,"" which naturally caused an uproar. However, the students claim that the full version of the slogan was, ""Who are you, who am I? Razakar, Razakar. Says who? Says who?Shoirachar, Shoirachar(autocrat).""
On July 15, AL General Secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) would give a ""fitting reply"" to the student protesters who had ""labelled themselves as Razakars and showed arrogance."" BCL President Saddam Hussain said, ""BCL is prepared to tackle this (quota reform movement) through political means.""
That afternoon, BCL launched its attack on the protesters.
On July 16, the protesters and BCL both called for a rally in front of DU's Raju Memorial at 12pm and 3pm, respectively. When the unarmed general students started gathering near Raju Memorial, BCL activists attacked them with metal rods, sticks, hockey sticks and guns. Many students were injured, and eventually, the protesters were dispersed.

Many were driven out of the halls.This provoked the protesters further. On July 17, the DU coordinators of the quota reform movement asked the students to gather at Shaheed Minar with sticks. This is the first time that the protesters took up a weapon in this movement. The same situation arose in JU and RU. Police, along with armed BCL members, conducted waves of assaults against the protesters in all three campuses.The protesters managed to put up a strong resistance as they were bigger as a group.

A curious tale of two cases
CU to launch 'e-car' service on campus for students
Gaza still bleeds
At the outset, we want to express our unambiguous condemnation of the mayhem created by ideologically and politically motivated groups whose aim was to destabilise our country, use the general discontent to instigate violence, and try to ""topple the government""—as claimed by some ministers and which, if true, we vigorously denounce. This has made us realise that our country faces internal enemies opposed to our development and overall success. The destruction of public property and the setting of fire to essential government offices, transport facilities and part of internet infrastructure that greatly crippled trade, manufacturing and the daily life of citizens need to be highly condemned, and the perpetrators exposed and punished within the law. We in the media will assist the government in unearthing this move against Bangladesh. Those who opposed our birth in 1971 must be resisted, defeated and destroyed.
However, there is something else that concerns us. What we are witnessing right now is a classic struggle to control the narrative. The battle is on to direct the ""truth"" with all the state machinery at play to establish it. The regime beneficiaries are joining the parade to justify the charade. George Orwell, welcome to Bangladesh. Sorry you have been here many times before.
Read moreDid we have to pay such a heavy price for this verdict?Slowly but surely, the story of the student movement for quota reform is fading from the official narrative and that of the BNP-Jamaat conspiracy to destabilise the country is gaining currency. In our view, both stories merit coverage and in-depth analyses. Why one is fading and the other is becoming bigger is because one suits those in power and the other embarrasses them. The blame game is on; demonising the other is in full swing. According to the new narrative, the students were mere ""pawns"" from the start and the whole episode was a part of an elaborate plan to destroy the economy and even ""topple the government.""Read moreSaluting the spirit of our young peopleWe are back to our old habit of never analysing events that shake us all and learn from our mistakes. How can we not immediately investigate how more than 150 people could be killed within a few days? We will perhaps never ask how the peaceful student movement went out of hand; why the government did not take steps in time to resolve the crisis; what triggered the students' anger; if there were any mistakes in handling the situation; why there were so many deaths; if the police made any attempt to control the crowd; if they had to shoot students when they did and if the shooting had to be so brutal; if bringing the ""Razakar"" issue was at all relevant; if anyone asked the students not to give that anti-liberation slogan (which they stopped the moment they realised their mistake); why with the deployment of BGB the death toll shoot up; if the BGB were given wrong instructions or if they turned out to be ""trigger happy."" On the political front, couldn't the Awami League—a party with such a long history and experience—have reached out to the students, instead of unleashing the Chhatra League to ""take care of them""? Was the call to shoot at sight necessary, and did the police firing not inflame the situation further? Why were helicopters used to fire upon demonstrators? There are many more such questions that must be asked and answered through impartial investigation. Otherwise, we will never learn from our mistakes and keep on repeating them.Couldn’t the Awami League have reached out to the students, instead of unleashing the Chhatra League to 'take care of them'? FILE PHOTO: RASHED SHUMONSo much blood, such mindless brutality, such indiscriminate beating of students demanding quota reform, such twisting of narratives and dangerous and fallacious tagging of general students as ""Razakars,"" attacking students in hospitals when they were receiving urgent medical assistance, such reckless shooting of demonstrators, and the ongoing indiscriminate arrest have created such ill feelings and deep suspicion that to expect an outright acceptance of the government's offer is unrealistic. Students' trust must be regained. A difficult task, but it must be attempted with sincerity and earnestness.Simply put, there are two distinct phases of the story of the student movement for quota reform that we have been seeing till date. The first phase started on June 5, when the High Courtset asidethe government decision to abolish the quota system completely through a government circular, and lasted till July 15. The second phase started on July 15, when the BCL started violently attacking the demonstrating students that triggered violence, which spread throughout the country resulting in large-scale killings by the law enforcement agencies.Read moreBring those who ordered the excessive use of force to accountWhat distinguishes the two phases is violence: there was none in the first and tragically plenty in the second. The first was totally peaceful and in the hands of the students, and the second highly violent with political elements having entered the movement, especially members of Jamaat and Shibir (the student front of Jamaat) as emerging evidence indicates.The government's attempt to totally ignore the first phase and put all its focus on the second is, we think, not reflective of what is uppermost in the public mind and, as such, not the most judicious of decisions. While attempt to unearth the deep conspiracy in the second phase must continue with utmost vigour—which we in the media will support and promote as long as it is evidence-based—ignoring the mistakes made in the first phase and not investigating how such a large number of deaths, injuries and physical assault on students occurred and not punishing those responsible will be a blunder of enormous proportions.When the movement started, it was only about quota reform. By the time it ended, many issues became added due to the government's incompetent and harsh handling of the situation. When there was not a single death, not a single instance of violence, when thousands of students were holding peaceful demonstrations on their respective campuses throughout the country, when students were inviting quota reform talks—that was the time when any government would have reached out to the demonstrating students. Ours did not.Read moreThe government should take responsibility for its mistakesInstead, we sawmore than 150 deaths, including that of demonstrating students, BCL cadres, police and the general public,in less than a week—highest ever in the history of independent Bangladesh—more than 3,000 injured (both highly conservative figures), and widespread beating of students and demonstrators under one guise or another. The government and the ruling party should not underestimate the depth of this feeling of the students of having been seriously wronged.Our reporters and photographers met so many parents, relatives and guardians who have lost their dear ones. Their stories bring out the deepest sense of anguish and disgust at the needlessness of it all. So many of the students have such vivid memories of friends and fellow demonstrators being killed or severely beaten up and injured by BCL and law enforcement members; that emotional and psychological wound cannot be expected to be healed overnight. That healing will occur only if the subsequent attitude of the authorities is one of genuine understanding, concern and care backed by a credible commitment of total exoneration of the students from legal harassment. This needs to be so because many quota demonstrators of 2018 had to face police investigation, court appearances and bail formalities for years, at significant legal expenses that many could not afford. Students know it and remember it, and fear its repetition.Did the police have to shoot students when they did, and if yes, did the shooting have to be so brutal? FILE PHOTO: ANISUR RAHMANThat anti-state elements riding on the shoulder of only a two-week-old student movement can destabilise us raises concerns as to how this could happen under a government that has been in continuous and unquestioned authority for the last 15-plus years. That a pro-liberation government, enjoying supreme power for a decade and a half, suddenly finds that anti-liberation forces have become such a threat that it needs the army to save itself—police, Rab and BGB having all failed—worries us immeasurably and raises the question as to whether the ruling party and the government need to revisit their policies and actions of the last 15-plus years, whether or not its own high-, mid- and lower-level leaders have served the party well, and whether cronyism and corruption inside the party needs a thorough looking into.This period needs to be assessed as much for the sake of the people as for the ruling party itself. In our view, it was during this period that the greatest party in the history of Pakistan and Bangladesh combined, and the one that lay at the heart of all democratic movements here, lost its way and became a money-making machine whose stature at the grassroots level is a pale shadow of its glorious past; whose leaders frankly admit that their survival is guaranteed only by muscle power and no moral power of ethics, honesty, patriotism, and values of our freedom struggle.Read moreThe irresponsible remarks of our responsible personsIt was during the same period that saw greatest harm being done to the most pivotal institution of democracy: free and fair elections. The last three elections—2014, 2018, and 2024 (the last one was a bit more competitive as AL dissenters were allowed to participate)—were mere rituals where voters were the least important elements, far outweighed by police, bureaucracy and money, and muscle power of the ruling party cadres. The ""shooting in the foot"" policy of BNP to boycott elections made election manipulation easier by the rulers.The obvious result of controlled elections was a controlled parliament that never saw any lively debate on any of the vital challenges that the country faces.As power consolidated and elections became largely predictable, the bureaucracy, police, intelligence community and all other state institutions—in fact, everyone holding government jobs—knew which side of the bread was buttered and acted accordingly. Favouritism and cronyism in business led to Bangladesh's corruption index hitting the roof and the rich-poor gap widening as never before. We saw the gradual but alarming erosion of accountability of state institutions, transparency of administrative processes, and politicisation of institutions of the state that crippled good governance.We must change the way we think, act, and engage with people, especially with the younger generation. FILE PHOTO: PRABIR DASNone of the above crucial questions will be asked and the business-as-usual attitude of the ""enemy"" doing it all will dominate our thoughts and narrative. The only way the situation will be handled will be more arrests of the same clang and repetition of what we have heard over the years.At this crucial moment, we must understand that ""what got us here will not take us there"" (borrowing from the title of Marshall Goldsmith's book), meaning to the higher level of development. We must change the way we think, act, and engage with people, especially with the younger generation. They are smarter, more knowledgeable, more tech-savvy, and far more confident than we ever were. They are citizens of the 21st century and will live and compete in the world of artificial intelligence. Our prime minister wants to build a ""Smart Bangladesh."" We all support her in that effort. But is killing, torturing, injuring, threatening and making students live in fear any way of making them proud participants of that ""Smart Bangladesh""? We must be among the biggest fools in the world to think that we can beat them, torture them and frighten them into submission. We have to win their hearts and minds and not bang their heads. The way we have handled the student protesters of the quota reform movement will greatly exacerbate brain drain. The AI world will make a global village of talents and no oppressive measure can hold them back.Focusing on the narrative of ""conspiracy"" and ignoring the one that involves students and the many lives lost may give some respite, but it is no way of creating confidence among the students about our future here. We really need to change our mindset. Otherwise, we will keep on repeating our mistakes. And given the fast-moving and competitive world, we are not likely to get too many chances.Mahfuz Anamis the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.FollowThe Daily Star Opinion on Facebookfor the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

We are back to our old habit of never analysing events that shake us all and learn from our mistakes. How can we not immediately investigate how more than 150 people could be killed within a few days? We will perhaps never ask how the peaceful student movement went out of hand; why the government did not take steps in time to resolve the crisis; what triggered the students' anger; if there were any mistakes in handling the situation; why there were so many deaths; if the police made any attempt to control the crowd; if they had to shoot students when they did and if the shooting had to be so brutal; if bringing the ""Razakar"" issue was at all relevant; if anyone asked the students not to give that anti-liberation slogan (which they stopped the moment they realised their mistake); why with the deployment of BGB the death toll shoot up; if the BGB were given wrong instructions or if they turned out to be ""trigger happy."" On the political front, couldn't the Awami League—a party with such a long history and experience—have reached out to the students, instead of unleashing the Chhatra League to ""take care of them""? Was the call to shoot at sight necessary, and did the police firing not inflame the situation further? Why were helicopters used to fire upon demonstrators? There are many more such questions that must be asked and answered through impartial investigation. Otherwise, we will never learn from our mistakes and keep on repeating them.
Couldn’t the Awami League have reached out to the students, instead of unleashing the Chhatra League to 'take care of them'? FILE PHOTO: RASHED SHUMONSo much blood, such mindless brutality, such indiscriminate beating of students demanding quota reform, such twisting of narratives and dangerous and fallacious tagging of general students as ""Razakars,"" attacking students in hospitals when they were receiving urgent medical assistance, such reckless shooting of demonstrators, and the ongoing indiscriminate arrest have created such ill feelings and deep suspicion that to expect an outright acceptance of the government's offer is unrealistic. Students' trust must be regained. A difficult task, but it must be attempted with sincerity and earnestness.Simply put, there are two distinct phases of the story of the student movement for quota reform that we have been seeing till date. The first phase started on June 5, when the High Courtset asidethe government decision to abolish the quota system completely through a government circular, and lasted till July 15. The second phase started on July 15, when the BCL started violently attacking the demonstrating students that triggered violence, which spread throughout the country resulting in large-scale killings by the law enforcement agencies.Read moreBring those who ordered the excessive use of force to accountWhat distinguishes the two phases is violence: there was none in the first and tragically plenty in the second. The first was totally peaceful and in the hands of the students, and the second highly violent with political elements having entered the movement, especially members of Jamaat and Shibir (the student front of Jamaat) as emerging evidence indicates.The government's attempt to totally ignore the first phase and put all its focus on the second is, we think, not reflective of what is uppermost in the public mind and, as such, not the most judicious of decisions. While attempt to unearth the deep conspiracy in the second phase must continue with utmost vigour—which we in the media will support and promote as long as it is evidence-based—ignoring the mistakes made in the first phase and not investigating how such a large number of deaths, injuries and physical assault on students occurred and not punishing those responsible will be a blunder of enormous proportions.When the movement started, it was only about quota reform. By the time it ended, many issues became added due to the government's incompetent and harsh handling of the situation. When there was not a single death, not a single instance of violence, when thousands of students were holding peaceful demonstrations on their respective campuses throughout the country, when students were inviting quota reform talks—that was the time when any government would have reached out to the demonstrating students.

That anti-state elements riding on the shoulder of only a two-week-old student movement can destabilise us raises concerns as to how this could happen under a government that has been in continuous and unquestioned authority for the last 15-plus years. That a pro-liberation government, enjoying supreme power for a decade and a half, suddenly finds that anti-liberation forces have become such a threat that it needs the army to save itself—police, Rab and BGB having all failed—worries us immeasurably and raises the question as to whether the ruling party and the government need to revisit their policies and actions of the last 15-plus years, whether or not its own high-, mid- and lower-level leaders have served the party well, and whether cronyism and corruption inside the party needs a thorough looking into.
This period needs to be assessed as much for the sake of the people as for the ruling party itself. In our view, it was during this period that the greatest party in the history of Pakistan and Bangladesh combined, and the one that lay at the heart of all democratic movements here, lost its way and became a money-making machine whose stature at the grassroots level is a pale shadow of its glorious past; whose leaders frankly admit that their survival is guaranteed only by muscle power and no moral power of ethics, honesty, patriotism, and values of our freedom struggle.

Lying in a hospital bed, teary-eyed Md Rifat was staring at his right leg, rather where his right leg used to be. He could not look away.
The 10th grader of Badda Alatunnessa Higher Secondary School was shot around 10:00am on July 19 while he went out of his home to see what was going on in Rampura.
He had two surgeries. His leg was amputated from the knee.
""I don't know whether I will be able to go to school again,"" Rifat said softly at the Casualty Ward-2 of the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (Nitor).
He was struggling to hold back his tears as he recalled the life-changing incident.
""I just wanted to see what was going on in my neighbourhood. I didn't go there to protest … I was having a sherbet near the Rampura U-loop, suddenly a bullet hit my right leg, and I fell to the ground.""
In the same ward, Imran Sarkar, a fourth-year student of philosophy at Dhaka College, was without his left leg. He was shot during a clash between the demonstrators and police in Rayerbazar area on July 19 afternoon.
""I was returning home after offering Juma prayers … All of a sudden, a bullet hit my left leg and I passed out,"" said Imran.
When he regained consciousness, he found himself in the hospital bed.
""How will I walk again?"" he said before bursting into tears.
He had another surgery yesterday afternoon.
At Nitor, Rifat and Imran are among eight people who lost their limbs after being shot during the recent violence. Of them, six lost their legs while two lost arms.
According to the hospital authorities, 238 patients with gunshot wounds, sustained between July 18 and July 22, had treatment at the hospital. Some of them have been discharged.
Doctors there feared they may not be able to save the limbs of a number of patients under treatment.
Md Mamun, a trucker from Bhairab in Kishoreganj, was lying in a bed of
Casualty Ward-1 on Wednesday.
The 30-year-old was brutally hacked when he was heading to Bhairab from Dhaka on July 19 afternoon.
""I was caught in the middle of a clash. There was gunfire all around me. As I got down from the truck for safety, some people got hold of me and attacked me with knives. I don't know them,"" he told this correspondent on Wednesday.
He had seven stitches on his left hand. However, his right hand bore several marks of stabs that became infected.
""The doctors told me there is no other option but to amputate my right hand. How will I drive without my right hand?"" Mamun said.
Doctors yesterday had to amputate his right hand, his family members told this paper.
During a visit to the hospital on Wednesday, this correspondent found 34 patients with gunshot wounds still under treatment at Casualty Ward-2.
Seven of them were shot in their arms and 26 in their legs.
The air was heavy with the cries of patients and their relatives. Some were looking for certain types of blood.
Many of them said they were running out of money since they had spent a lot to travel to Dhaka and had been to multiple hospitals before getting to Nitor.
Kazi Shamim Uzzaman, director of Nitor, said all the patients admitted there underwent surgeries and some had multiple surgeries.
""Even after surgeries, some of them still have bullets in their bodies,"" the director said.
The country witnessed unprecedented violence centring the quota reform demonstration. The non-violent movement turned violent after Chhatra League menattackedagitating students at Dhaka University and some other universities on July 15.
The violence escalated further in the following days after several students were killed in clashes. The government eventually imposed a nationwide curfew and deployed the armed forces.
According to the count of The Daily Star, since July 16, at least 156 people, including three police personnel, were killed. Several thousand were wounded in clashes between agitators and law enforcers, who were aided allegedly by ruling party activists.
The death toll may rise as The Daily Star could not reach many hospitals in Dhaka and elsewhere where many critically injured were taken for treatment. Also, many friends and families reportedly took the bodies of their loved-ones from the scenes and this newspaper could not contact them. The Daily Star's count of the death toll is based solely on hospital and police sources.

The National Theatre Hall and two rehearsal rooms at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy are set to reopen this Friday (October 11), although in a limited capacity. The decision was made yesterday (October 7) during a coordination meeting between officials of the academy and the army. Due to the current situation, some special precautions will be in place, alongside the existing hall allocation policy.
Sources at Shilpakala Academy confirmed that since the student-led protests, army personnel have been stationed in various rooms of the National Theatre Hall, making it impossible to allocate spaces for events or rehearsals. However, as conditions have improved, and following requests from cultural groups and organisations, the hall and two rehearsal rooms will now be available for theatre performances and rehearsals, albeit under strict conditions.
In a written statement, Shilpakala Academy outlined specific guidelines for theatre groups. Only one show will be allowed per group in the main hall per shift, and applications for hall bookings must be submitted online. Additionally, groups must provide a written list of members on the organisation's official letterhead and submit it to the theatre and film department office. This list will be used to control access at the entrance on the designated day of the performance.
The main gate of the National Theatre Hall will open for audience members two hours prior to a show, but it will remain closed otherwise. The main hall's performers will receive priority booking for the rehearsal rooms. If they do not require the rehearsal space, it will be allocated to other groups. In such cases, other groups will also need to submit a list of their members to the appropriate office.
Only members of the approved groups, users of the rehearsal rooms, Shilpakala Academy staff, army personnel, and audience members with tickets or invitations will be allowed entry through the main gate. Journalists can enter by showing their press IDs. Theatre artistes, journalists, and ticket-holding or invited guests must park their vehicles in the designated parking area on the ground floor of the theatre.
The National Theatre Hall had been closed since July 19, when a play scheduled to be performed at Shilpakala Academy's Experimental Theatre was cancelled due to the political situation. Since then, no theatre performances have taken place at any Shilpakala Academy venue across the country.
This reopening marks a hopeful step towards reviving the theatre scene in Dhaka and beyond, with careful consideration of the safety and security of all involved.

""Invisible Stories"", a captivating body puppet theatre performance, has recently debuted at La Galerie, Alliance Française de Dhaka. The show enchanted audiences with its surreal portrayal of the mystical world intertwined with daily life in Dhaka.
Directed by French puppeteer Laurie Cannac, the show featured Bangladeshi artistes Diana Meriline and Md Farhad Ahmed.
This multidisciplinary performance blends storytelling, puppetry, dance, and song, offering a magical exploration of Bangladesh's rich folklore and history.
The story follows two scientists in Dhaka investigating the presence of ghosts in everyday life. Their research soon transforms into a fantastical journey to the Sundarbans, where they encounter the wilderness, spiritual wisdom, and the supernatural forces embedded in the region. Combining humour and horror, the production draws from various Bengali oral traditions, including ghost stories and supernatural elements.
Through the artistes' use of puppetry and physical movement, the invisible becomes visible, offering a glimpse into the unseen forces shaping the world around us. From ""tree ghosts"" blamed for Dhaka's infamous traffic to the ""ectoplasm"" holding up the city's walls, the show plays with the supernatural in ways that are both whimsical and profound.
Laurie Cannac has long been inspired by traditional tales, and she saw Bangladesh's folklore as a natural fit for her unique approach to puppetry. ""I always work with traditional old tales, so when I was invited to create a show in Bangladesh, I looked into stories popular here,"" she explained. ""Ghost stories are vivid and emotional—they're scary but also funny. And as a puppeteer, ghosts are very inspiring."" Laurie's creative process with the actors involved extensive improvisation, especially around body movement and puppetry. The choice to use body puppetry—where human actors manipulate life-sized puppets—was a natural one.
""The world of traditional tales is perfect for body puppets, especially the Bangladeshi ghost world. Body puppets are human-sized, just like ghosts, and their movements mirror human ones,"" she noted. Laurie also highlighted the similarities between puppets and ghosts, describing both as figures hovering between life and death.
Although grounded in tradition, ""Invisible Stories"" addresses contemporary issues, creatively linking ancient ghost tales to modern challenges, such as Dhaka's notorious traffic. ""It seemed clear to me that old ghost tales still have relevance in everyday life,"" Laurie remarked. ""For instance, I used the idea that Dhaka's traffic jams might be caused by tree ghosts who migrated to the city due to rural exodus."" The show also explores the contrast between scientific rationalism and a more spiritual, nature-connected worldview. The two main characters, both scientists, embody these opposing perspectives. As the story unfolds, the more scientifically-minded character is humbled by her experiences in the Sundarbans, ultimately developing a newfound respect for nature and the supernatural.
Laurie shared that this aspect of the story was inspired by her interactions with the people of the Sundarbans. ""The strength of their traditional way of life and thinking fascinated me. The Sundarbans are victims of climate change but also part of the solution. I deeply respect the people there,"" she said.
Both Diana Meriline and Md Farhad Ahmed bring exceptional talent and experience to the production. Diana, a student at Prachyanat School of Acting and Design, has been involved in theatre since 2018, while Farhad has worked with Prachyanat Theatre since 2012 and Jolputul Puppets since 2014.
The technical aspects of the performance, including the use of objects and movement, further enhance the portrayal of the invisible, allowing the audience to engage with unseen forces. This inventive approach enables the performers to explore Bangladesh's rich folklore, encompassing ghost stories from various religious communities.
Beyond its supernatural elements, ""Invisible Stories"" is steeped in Bangladesh's history. The play references historical ghosts, such as ghost trains, inspired by the tragic convoys during the 1947 partition. These elements highlight the lingering effects of historical events on the present, adding depth to the narrative. The exploration of personal ghosts, connected to the Jungian concept of the collective unconscious, deepens the relationships between the characters. ""Puppets are metaphoric—they are living images that spark our imagination. They bring cultural narratives to life and can question society with humour and poetry,"" Laurie observed.
""Invisible Stories"" is set to leave a lasting impact, with upcoming performances scheduled in Chattogram, the Sundarbans, and Dhaka's Brihatta Art Foundation as part of the River Heritage Project. The production has also been selected for the World Festival of Puppet Theatre in France, and discussions are already underway for a European tour.

Taylor Swift has now been named the wealthiest female musician in the world, overtaking Rihanna with an estimated net worth of US $1.6 billion, as per Forbes. This achievement follows Swift's entry into the billionaire club in October 2023, primarily driven by the massive success of her Eras Tour and the significant worth of her music catalogue.
At 34, Taylor Swift is the first musician to achieve billionaire status primarily through her music and live performances. Her fortune includes $600 million from tours and royalties, $600 million from her music catalogue, and $125 million in real estate holdings.
With this milestone, Taylor Swift has surpassed Rihanna, who was previously the wealthiest female musician, mainly due to the success of her Fenty Beauty and Savage x Fenty brands. Rihanna's net worth is now estimated at $1.4 billion, putting her just behind Swift on the Forbes rankings.
Taylor Swift is positioned at #2,117 on Forbes' global billionaires list, while Rihanna holds the #2,336 spot. When compared to other affluent female musicians, Swift's net worth far exceeds that of stars such as Beyoncé, Madonna, and Celine Dion.
Swift is currently on a break but will resume her Eras Tour in Miami on October 18, 2024.

RM's much-anticipated documentary, ""RM: Right People, Wrong Person,"" made its grand debut at the prestigious Busan International Film Festival.
This cinematic piece, a creative reflection of his second solo album of the same name, graced the festival's stage on the serene evening of October 7, KST. The album, which first saw the light of day on May 24 this year, was soon followed by the evocative release of Muse in July, capturing hearts anew.
RM's solo journey, however, began even earlier, with the soulful Indigo in 2020—a poignant milestone that set the stage for his artistic evolution.
The rapper's debut documentary premiered in the Open Cinema section of the 29th Busan International Film Festival, held at the outdoor theatre of the Busan Cinema Center.
This screening marked the first time a K-pop documentary had been invited to the Open Cinema section of the festival. The film received high praise from BIFF, which described it as ""an album-making documentary and a uniquely special journal of youth.""
Despite heavy rain disrupting the festival, fans and audiences remained undeterred, attending the outdoor theatre premiere to show their support for RM. Before the screening, the film's director, Lee Seok Joon, assistant director, Im Soo Bin, music director Junkyard (JNKYRD), and contributors to RM's album, including Balming Tiger's San Yawn and Jang Se Hun, took to the stage to greet the excited crowd.
The energy of RM's fans and the audience reached its peak when the Indigo singer first appeared on screen. In the video, RM shared, ""This documentary reveals the raw, human side of Kim Nam Joon."" He continued, ""Our perception of what's 'Right' and 'Wrong' shifts constantly. Through this journey, I've come to see myself as one of the 'Right' people.""
The documentary centres on RM's eight-month journey in crafting the album, showcasing him both as the leader of BTS and a solo artist. It highlights his genuine emotions and personal moments, offering an intimate glimpse into his life. Following its successful premiere at BIFF, the film is set for a worldwide release in December, allowing a global audience to experience it.

""Joker: Folie à Deux"", the highly anticipated sequel to the 2019 hit ""Joker"", has struggled to meet expectations at the US box office, delivering a disappointing performance both domestically and internationally.
Despite debuting in the top spot in North America, the film earned significantly less than its predecessor, with early box office numbers raising concerns. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, opened with just US $81.1 million during its six-day opening, a sharp decline from the original ""Joker"", which brought in US $150.8 million in its opening weekend in 2019.
Trade analysts initially projected a debut between US $50 million and US $65 million but later revised expectations to US $70 million. However, the actual weekend earnings fell short, totalling US $40 million in North America.
Internationally, the movie grossed US $121.1 million, a significant drop from the original's worldwide debut of US $247 million. ""Joker 2"" also performed worse than recent superhero films like ""The Flash"" and ""Black Adam"", which earned US $130.1 million and US $142.9 million globally in their opening weekends, respectively.
The film, which cost an estimated US $190 million to produce, has been receiving negative feedback online. Fans have expressed their disappointment with the movie's storyline and overall execution, with some blaming its poor performance on bad word-of-mouth. The movie also received a concerning D rating from CinemaScore, a clear sign that audiences were not impressed.
Directed by Todd Phillips and starring Phoenix as the Joker and Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" was released in over 70 countries on October 4. However, the film's lukewarm reception and underwhelming box office results indicate that the sequel has failed to capture the magic of the original, which became a cultural phenomenon and earned Phoenix an Academy Award for Best Actor.

A heartfelt gathering titled ""Sediner Ek Bikele"" was held yesterday to honour the late musician Hassan Abidur Reza Jewel. Friends, family, and colleagues of the renowned singer gathered to celebrate his life and reflect on his contributions to the music and media industry.
The event, held at the Mahila Samiti Auditorium in Bailey Road, featured a discussion on Jewel's illustrious career, where prominent figures like singer Naquib Khan, lyricist Zulfikar Russell, producer Syed Awlad, media personality Gausul Alam Shaon, reciter Shimul Mustafa, and architect Aka Reza Ghalib shared personal anecdotes and insights. The programme was presented by musicians Bappa Mazumder, Rashid Khan, and Masuduzzaman. Attendees from television, newspapers, and the cultural sector also participated, highlighting the far-reaching impact Jewel had across various creative fields.
Jewel, a beloved figure in the Bangladeshi music scene, passed away on July 30 after a prolonged battle with cancer. His melodic style and soulful voice left a lasting impression on Bengali music, with 10 solo albums and over 50 collaborative projects to his name. Songs like ""Sediner Ek Bikele,"" ""Chokher Bhetor Swapno Thake"", ""Shamne Tomar Chader Pahar"" remain fan favourites.
Apart from his musical legacy, Jewel was a multi-talented television program maker, event organiser, and media producer. He worked on notable television shows such as ""Bolte Chai"", ""Lux Super Star"", and ""Khude Gaanraj"", and held key positions in the industry, including head of Events at Channel i and head of Programmes at Maasranga Television. His work in the media opened doors for many young talents and left a lasting impact on the entertainment industry.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has restructured the Full-Length Film Grant Committee to enhance professionalism and transparency in the selection of state-funded films.
The newly appointed 10-member committee, led by government adviser Md Nahid Islam, will oversee the allocation of grants for the 2024-25 fiscal year, ensuring that creative and culturally significant films receive the necessary funding.
A government notice, issued by Deputy Secretary Md Saiful Islam today (October 7), confirmed this reformation. The notice also highlighted the government's commitment to encouraging creativity in the film industry while preserving Bangladesh's cultural heritage.
The new committee will assess proposals for full-length films under the Full-Length Film Grant Policy 2020 (Revised). Along with the committee chair and secretary, the other members include the secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the managing director of the Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC), Dhaka University professor Abul Bashar Md Ziaul Haque Bhuiyan, actor-director Titas Zia, filmmaker and producer Akram Khan, filmmaker Nargis Akter, Rainbow Film Society President Ahmed Muztaba Zamal, and actress Zakia Bari Mamo.
Additionally, the Short Film Grant Script Selection Committee was also restructured.
Renowned film critic Ahmed Muztaba Zamal, who was re-appointed to the Full-Length Film Grant Committee for the fifth time, shared his enthusiasm for the committee's new composition. ""Many of my colleagues in this committee are professionals I've worked with before, and I expect positive outcomes from our collaboration. As always, I'll strive to ensure that deserving filmmakers receive the grants,"" he said.
Other members of the Short Film Script Selection Committee include filmmaker and critic Rashidul Islam (Parthib Rashed), writer and journalist Muhammad Asadullah, and filmmaker Umme Salma Usha.
The ministry has tasked these committees with reviewing the grant applications for both full-length and short films, keeping the country's cultural heritage at the forefront of their decisions.
In line with these efforts, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has reiterated its focus on fostering creativity and supporting filmmakers who can contribute to Bangladesh's cultural narrative through compelling and innovative films.

In Hinduism, flowers are essential not only in worship but also in every other aspect of life. Garlands, single flowers, and even petals are used to form a connection between worshippers and the deity being venerated. In the simplicity of floral blooms, devotees find a pure form, expressing their homage to the gods and goddesses; their beauty and scent create an ambience that elevates the entire spiritual experience.
The connection becomes even more evident while performing puja, where culture and religious rites come together. The use of flowers in all aspects of their lives, be it lavish weddings or joyous celebrations like Durga Puja, sets the mood for the occasion.
Hibiscus (jaba) holds a place of distinction during Durga Puja as does the lotus (Padma). Marigolds in their orange and yellow hues are a staple, as are jasmines with their white petals and enchanting fragrance. These contrasts of hues and varied fragrances set an aura befitting the presence of Maa Durga and her celestial children.
While we are more familiar with the selection of flowers for the puja, many are unaware of the significance numbers (of flowers) play in the rites. The worship of Durga, for instance, can be done through flowers numbering between one and nine. In contrast, the worship of Lord Shiva is done through ten floral blossoms. Devotees offer blossoms at the altar of the gods and goddesses creating a moment of pure devotion, while chanting mantras and expressing their undivided faith as a gesture of thankfulness.
Flowers take centre stage in fashion, especially during the ten days of Durga puja, as women decked in their best sarees don the freshest blooms to accessorise, from their neat hairdo to wearing floral bracelets and waistbands.
Some go for a solitary bloom tucked behind the ear. While roses are a clear favourite, orchids are a new addition to this classic look. Then some prefer to go for the more refined ""sleek look"" — parting their hair at the top and having floral garlands adorning the parted lines and encircling the bun. For those who prefer to wear a braid, garlands are often intertwined with the plaits enhancing the overall look.
While hopping between puja mandaps, women often embrace a more carefree style — clad in sarees, adorned with glass bangles, a teep on the forehead, and a floral crown. The beauty of this boho-chic look lies in its versatility. She truly ""walks in beauty"" as she effortlessly carries the look all day, from one pandal to another, while navigating Dhaka's notorious traffic.
Flowers are not mere decorations; they have a deeper connection with the human soul and the higher powers. Each bloom offered during the festival carries the essence of spiritual meaning, whether it be the power of the hibiscus, the purity of the lotus, or the joyful celebration embodied by the marigold.
Wearing flowers as fashion accessories is just an extension of that expression. Embracing flowers in our entire existence is just another way of connecting to that one power that nurtures and governs the entire universe."

A curious tale of two cases

A record number of climbers are gathered in Tibet to complete mountaineering's pinnacle achievement, summiting the world's tallest 14 peaks.
Only about 50 climbers have climbed all mountain peaks above 8,000 metres (26,250 feet), a feat that took most years, or even decades, to complete.
About 20 are vying for the record books this month, some spurred by a blockbuster Netflix documentary giving the endeavour a wider profile.
Technological advancements have made the feat easier to accomplish.
""We are growing as a community, and we are representing mountaineering all over the world,"" Pakistani climber Shehroze Kashif, 22, told AFP.
""I think that's great... they are completing their dream, as I am.""
It took Italian climber Reinhold Messner 16 years from his initial summit to become the first person in the world considered to have climbed all 14 peaks in 1986.
But most of the climbers assembled in the Chinese Himalayas at the base camp of Mount Shisha Pangma only began their attempts within the past few years.
They have already summited the 13 other highest peaks, located in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges, straddling Nepal, Pakistan, Tibet and India.
Many have been waiting to scale the 8,027-metre-high (26,335 feet) Tibetan peak since last year, when China closed the mountain to climbers after two American women and their Nepali guides were killed in an avalanche.
'Mountains attract them'
The aspirants are a mix of seasoned veterans and rising stars.
Teenage Nepali climber Nima Rinji Sherpa, 18, aims to be the youngest to climb all 14.
Several hope to be the first from their respective countries to accomplish the feat.
Advances in mountaineering technology, weather forecasting and logistical support have made this once-inaccessible goal more achievable -- particularly for those who can afford it.
Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summit Treks, Nepal's biggest mountaineering expedition company, told AFP that climbers could expect to pay up to $700,000 for full support teams.
But he said the hefty price tag had not dissuaded a growing number of people from pursuing the endeavour.
""They climb one or two, and then the mountains attract them,"" he said. ""Soon they might decide to climb them all"".
Teams of support crews and helicopters for rapid transportation between base camps have allowed climbers to tackle multiple mountains in a single season.
""It is clear that the pioneers back then, they did much more difficult, dangerous and exceptional ascents,"" German mountaineering chronicler Eberhard Jurgalski told AFP.
""Now it is possible to do them within three months. The logistics are so world-class now.""
British-Nepali climber Nirmal Purja famously completed the 14 peaks in just over six months in 2019, shattering the previous record of seven years.
His efforts were chronicled in a Netflix documentary, inspiring a new wave of athletes to try and eclipse his speed run.
Norwegian climber Kristin Harila and her Nepali guide Tenjen Lama Sherpa -- the latter who died attempting to summit Shisha Pangma last year -- now hold the record.
They climbed the giant mountains in 92 days, ending in July 2023.
The pair also reached the ""true summits"" of all the mountains, which many previous climbers had missed.
This month, at least six have already completed the feat after summiting Shisha Pangma, including the first Japanese, Pakistani and female American climbers.
They also included Nirmal Purja again, who this time said he was climbing all 14 without supplementary oxygen.
'Another challenge'
The trend towards speed has not always been welcomed by the mountaineering fraternity.
Veteran climbers have criticised Purja and Harila for using helicopters, pre-prepared routes and support teams.
Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, who is aiming to become the first woman from Nepal to summit all 14 peaks, said the style of ascent dictated how much it was valued by other alpinists.
""Some climb 14 peaks... and maybe even have climbed Everest several times, but some don't have the capacity to climb without support,"" she told AFP.
But Russian climber Alina Pekova, also attempting the Tibetan summit to finish her 14-peak climb, said that speed ascents were an endurance test.
""If you can climb it a fast way, why not try?"" she told AFP. ""That's another challenge.""

This time around it seems to be easier to write about things we will not do for Pujo.
A bit of background. First, my favourite city, my favourite country went through an incredible upheaval through July and a large part of August. While that dust has mostly settled, it is not all back to normal, if I understand correctly. And I am trying to understand from a distance, through social and traditional media and first-hand accounts of friends.
Then, my city, Kolkata, witnessed a heinous crime in what is supposed to be a safe zone, a hospital. The whole city went into a shock. And then the city exploded with anger, frustration and sorrow. And this continues to the day, casting a pall on Pujo preparations and the festive feeling.
Quite a few things have changed. We will do quite a few things differently this year. Usually, by now, the streets should have been bedecked with banners and decorations which is not the case yet. The streets still look a little bare. And people still wear an empty look, for we are waiting for justice. Justice for the deceased. And hoping for safe workplaces.
There are a few things we will not do this time around. The complex we live in usually has a lot of fun and festivities for Pujo. The whole community comes together to have small events during the day. Small ones, like antakshari, like quizzes, like children doing sit and draw. The evenings are filled with songs and dance. Mornings and evenings are punctuated with community lunch. Fish one day.  Vegetarian the next. Biryani another day. And the crowd favourite, mangsho bhaat, on Dashami.
This year we have decided to do without the fun and frolic. And the community lunch. Pujo will be a solemn affair this time around. All we will do is hope feverishly for justice. Hope for this nightmare to end. Hope for better days, safer days. For this is the true spirit of Pujo. Pomp and grandeur can wait for another year."

""Dhak, dhol, jhajor baaje,"" we recite as children and there is no denying that the beats of the drums that we call 'dhak' has something robustly unique about it. Dhak is a familiar musical instrument that is native to the Indian subcontinent.
Aside from their uniquely loud palpitating beats, there are stories behind the sound. Stories that have always been there. Stories of the dhakis.
The signature beat of a dhak is impossible to miss or confuse with anything else. We find many references to this in our literature and it's easy to understand why. Durga Puja does not sound so festive without the frenzied beats of dhak.
The instrument itself is of medieval origin but it is said that dhak was already in play during the Vedic period. The large instrument is made out of a wooden frame with a leather membrane stretched over the opening. The cylindrical or barrel-shaped membranophone is usually around three feet in size. Beating on the membrane creates a loud noise that has a different aura with the power to excite people. Perhaps this is why we often see dhak beats are accompanied by people dancing around them almost in a frenzy.
Ideally, a dhak is made out of mango wood. One can buy a dhak for around Tk 12,000. However, most dhakis prefer to make their own.
""Everything about dhak, whether it's creating a new one from scratch or repairing the current one, I do it myself. Sure, you can buy one at a shop and it won't be bad, but I would say that making one is so much better. You can make it just how you want it,"" said Ashit Das, a middle-aged dhaki from Pabna.
Sangkar Das from Munshiganj, a seasoned dhaki who has played at all sorts of festivals, had the same sentiment. ""Doing everything myself is not only cheaper, it's just better. I can tweak the instrument how I want.""
Playing dhak is no easy task and takes years of practice. Most dhakis start with other instruments and later learn the workings and beats of dhak as they find their talent.
""You start with kashi and continue to practice. It brings fluidity to your hand movement. Later, you pick up the dhak,"" explained Ashit using terms like ""haat khulte hobe"".
Sangkar Das has been playing dhak at Mangal Shobhajatra, pujas, and many other festivals for more than two decades. This experienced artiste started his journey by playing kashi. Later, he picked up dhol and finally, in his maturity, took on the mantle of a dhaki. Now, he has a legacy to pass on, one that is quite common for dhakis. Passing the torch, or in this case — the stick.
""I learned from my father. And likewise, my elder son has also learned to play the dhak. This year, he will play by himself,"" he said proudly, as all fathers would be watching his legacy continue.
Tapan Chandra Das plays dhak at Dhakeshwari Temple. He learned to play by watching his father, who was also a dhaki at Dhakeshwari Temple. ""My father used to try to set me to study. But I didn't like to study that much, instead I would flee and come here and watch my father play the dhak.""
Goda Das is another dhaki who is part of a band. ""I learned from my ustad, Monmohon, who is long gone. Some people start early, I learned this when I was 28 years old. I used to play tabla at that time, and later picked up on dhak, dhol, and other membranophone instruments,"" said the veteran artiste.
Nothing is ever easy, but perhaps being a professional dhaki is a bit too difficult. It is far from stable. Dhakis who manage to get a booking for smaller festivals and programmes may earn around Tk 1,000-1,500 for a day's work. And it's rare these days to get bookings regularly. As a result, most dhakis need to resort to an alternative source of income to support themselves.
During the days of Durga puja, dhakis stay at the mandap the whole time. Sometimes, they are alone, but mostly, they are accompanied by a band or a few other artistes. Even though most of them are Hindu, they have to stay away from their family during the puja days because of their job, and they have been doing it every year.
While everyone dances to the beat of their drums, which indeed invokes the aura of Durga puja, the dhakis make a silent sacrifice, one that is overwritten by the beats of their drums.
""Puja is the season for us. We can earn a decent amount during these five days. But the rest of the year is not so easy,"" said Ashit, who drives an auto-rickshaw to support himself and his family.
""There has been a massive decline in bookings since COVID,"" said Sangkar, who has to resort to farming and agriculture to maintain his family. ""Obviously, puja is the time when business blooms but otherwise, business is practically non-existent. There was a time when I used to get bookings for four or five days of the week. Now that's a dream,"" he added.
While dhak has been around for quite some time, its future looks rather bleak. Most dhakis are still carrying on the tradition that was bestowed upon them by their ancestors but this family profession will not last long.
""I have been playing here for about 30-35 years, I guess. Before me, my father used to play and before that my grandfather. We have been performing here for seven generations,"" said Tapan Chandra Das, stating that he has been trying to teach his sons to play dhak so that they may carry on the legacy, but he's not so sure whether they are interested.
Sangkar Das has two sons and only one of them has learned to play the dhak. And with the current state of the profession, he has no complaints about his other son not being a part of the family legacy.
Ashit learned the beats from his father. He has two daughters, and he thinks this will be the end of the family heritage. ""My father still plays and he goes across districts. I drum locally. But I don't think this profession will last in my family after I am gone,"" he said thoughtfully.
Some people are still in love with the beats and just can't stay away. There will always be people like that but the number is very limited. Goda Das from Natore belongs to this group of people.
""I started hanging out with the band when I was little because I have always loved festivals. There was a time when you could support your family in this trade but now, it's no longer possible. Even as part of a band, I can't make ends meet,"" he said, adding that neither his son nor his daughter is following his footsteps and he doesn't blame them either.
Everyone dances to the divine beat of the drums, but rarely does someone stop to think about the dhaki. Some of these artistes are immensely talented, but there is no one to nurture them. Most of the dhakis are neglected and spend their days as nothing more than another figure behind the instrument. With this declining trend, dhakis will become extinct soon, and an important part of our cultural element will be lost to time unless we do something about it."

The following pointers can help you take control of this harmful habit but the first step to any solution is to accept your problem. One must remember that no habit is formed in a day and it will take some time to break the pattern.
Every time the phone buzzes, our muscle memory goes off to pick it up. It is perhaps not possible to turn off your phone on most days but you can certainly turn off notifications on social media!
The key is to evaluate each app and decide whether its notifications truly add value to your life or contribute to your scrolling habit. This option is a simple and effective way to prevent your urge to scroll on socials.
Your phone has a built-in app — Digital Wellbeing, and like Screen Time for the iPhone, it can tell you about your phone use and help you set up limits on it.
You can see data on which app you spend most time on. It can be eye-opening to review your data as you will be more aware of your habits. It can help you identify patterns in your usage, such as certain times of day when you are more inclined to scroll. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate smartphone usage but to use it in a mindful and controlled way.
If you have the habit of charging your phone by your bed, you will struggle with falling asleep at a decent hour due to your endless scrolling, and in the morning, you repeat the same pattern before even starting your day. Try charging your phone away from your bed.
If you do not want to go through the hassle of monitoring your usage activity, try automating daily limits on your socials. Most devices and apps offer features that allow you to set automatic limits for specific times of day, days of the week, or after a certain amount of usage.
You could set your device to disable certain apps after 10 PM or after you have used them for an hour during the day.
This one is more difficult than the other methods to follow. Mindfulness and meditation apps can make the practices more accessible to beginners. Both meditation and mindfulness can help lower stress levels and even help you get a better night's sleep. ""Action For Happiness"" is one app you can download for helpful content."

Recently, a young high school student passionate about business is redefining what it means to be an entrepreneur in the city. In a world where startups are often associated with professionals or idea-enthusiastic university graduates, Nafiz took the bold step to open a simple food cart business in his neighbourhood.
A class IX student at Dhaka Residential Model College, Nafiz Azad Prithibi along with his mother, started a food stall at Ring Road, Mohammadpur on 18 September. Later, he moved the business to a small food cart on the lane just beside Suchona Community Center.
""Nafiz Food Corner"" does not have many fancy decorations; it is the food and the value for money it offers that attracts people. A menu attached to the cart features a variety of items such as tandoori chicken, chicken shashlik, noodles, soup, dragon fruit/vanilla-nut juice, and green coconut pudding, each of which is priced at/under Tk 50.
Nafiz elaborated, ""My mother has prepared every item at home before it arrived at the cart. Our job here is to deep fry the chicken items so diners can eat them right out of the pan. So, technically, the customers are getting homemade fresh food.
""I care about reaching everyone, especially the students. This is why I have made it a priority to keep the cost within a range that's affordable, without compromising on quality.""
When asked how he is balancing studies with business, he responded —
""It's challenging but doable. As a matter of fact, I had a class test today. I think willpower is all that is required to overcome challenges, whether someone is pursuing education, entrepreneurship, or a full-time job. Then again, it's the greatest blessing one can get when this willpower combines with the surrounding support. The only reason I am here today is because of the encouragement from my family and friends.""
Although the venture is relatively young, the cart enjoys tremendous popularity. Nafiz and his cousins were seen constantly stirring the tandoori chicken and chicken shashlik in the pan, while his father and the staff served soup, noodles, and juice to the customers.
Nafiz's father, Abul Kalam Azad Shahin is also a businessman. He shared, ""I was hesitant when he first talked about this business. I kept telling myself that he wasn't doing anything wrong. So eventually, I decided to provide both mental and financial support to my son. I am a father, you know, that's the least I could do.""
Shahin was overwhelmed to see such a huge crowd at the shop.
""None of this would have been possible without my wife. Despite being a working woman in the banking sector, she always managed her time to support her son. Each moment, Nafiz had his mother by his side. She is, in fact, on the way from her office,"" he added.
It was almost 7:30 PM in the evening and all the food items were sold out. Rifat, a customer, shared his experience, ""Nafiz's decision to start a business is commendable. I stopped by the road when I noticed the crowd. Although I was aware of the popular Facebook post, I was unaware of the actual location. ""
Nafiz Azad Prithibi is a glaring example that age is no barrier to being a business owner. He wishes to take the business to newer heights. When asked, ""Where do you see yourself in the future?"" He smilingly replied, ""As someone who continues to inspire young minds out there."""

Halloween is creeping up fast! Have you made your plans or are you still wondering where to go? Your options will vary from legendary castles to catacombs to adventure parks, depending on whether you are looking for costume parties, ghost tours, or aiming for deeper exploration into tradition and history.
So, if you are ready to spice up your spooky seasons, here is a guide to some of the best Halloween experiences around the world. No matter your Halloween style, each destination mentioned offers a unique way to celebrate the spooky season, combining tradition, thrill, and festivity. Pick your adventure and be prepared for a Halloween like no other!
The city ranks among Europe's most haunted cities to celebrate Halloween. For thrill-seekers, Edinburgh offers an experience like no other. Starting from tours in underground vaults and closes, to lantern-led walks into graveyards, the city will take you to a shadowy world where the line between the living and the dead blurs.
For a more family-friendly affair, Dalkeith Country Park, located just outside the city can be a good option for soft-scare offering pumpkin picking, ghostly storytelling, and outdoor movie screening of Halloween classics.
Even when it is about a modern celebration, Conifox Adventure Park will not let you down with twists like a witches' labyrinth, broomstick flying school, and a monster disco, perfect for the young (and the young at heart!).
Salem, Massachusetts, often called 'Witch City,' comes alive as a haunting wonderland each October. Wondered what it would be like to walk the streets of a town known for one of America's darkest episodes, the Salem Witch Trials of the 1690s.
With moonlit ghost tours into places like Gallows Hill Park and the Witch House serving as reminders of the grim past, the city will not disappoint you. If you are not much into history and rather looking for Halloween enthusiasm, you can just stroll through the vendor-lined street, enjoy carnival rides, or join fellow Halloween enthusiasts costumed in parades.
Unlike other Halloween parades, Kawasaki Parade is highly organised and requires participants to apply months before. The parade is usually held on the last Sunday in October ensuring every costume is nothing short of an extra-ordinary. Participants put in great effort and for good reason — the best costume gets a 500,000-yen prize.
Besides the costume competition, Kawasaki hosts a range of Halloween activities like street performances, live music, dance parties, etc. Even if you are not into parades or dance parties, Kawasaki will offer you horror film screenings and family-friendly events.
Whether you are a participant or a bystander, the parade will offer you an experience which blends traditional Halloween elements with Japanese pop culture, making it a one-of-a-kind event in Japan.
Do you remember the haunting stories of Count Dracula from the iconic novels and films? Have you ever imagined stepping into that world? Well, Halloween at Bran Castle gives you that chance for an authentic adventure.
Bran Castle, a medieval fortress in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania is known as ""Dracula's Castle"" to the outside world. The castle, with cobwebbed stone walls and haunting shadows, creates the absolute setting for a spooky experience inspired by the famous tale of Bram Stoker.
The annual Halloween party typically takes place on the Saturday closest to 31 October, with live performances, gothic decorations, and guests showing up in creative costumes, to match the haunting atmosphere.
If you are looking for a vibrant celebration this Halloween, Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, in Oaxaca, Mexico can be your go-to destination. Though this festival in Oaxaca is typically celebrated on the first two days of November just like the rest of Mexico, in reality, the celebrations start on the night of 31 October 31with the spirits returning at midnight.
This festival honours the deceased, loved ones through vibrant parades, rituals, and traditional dance. The families clean and decorate the graveyard of their loved ones with flowers, candles, and favourite foods to invite their spirits for a reunion.
Featuring haunted houses, scare zones, and live performances, Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights is one of the premier Halloween attractions in Asia. Every year Universal Studios partners with horror franchises, creating new themed haunted houses inspired by classic horror characters, twisted folklore, popular films, and TV shows.
Besides haunted houses, scary zones and scary shows are arranged where costumed actors participate leaving no room free from the terror. And for those looking for a break from scares, the park offers night-time rides, themed dining and movie screenings, creating intense adrenaline-filled events. If you want to immerse yourself in such an unforgettable experience, book your tickets urgently as the month-long Halloween Horror Nights will continue until 4 November.
A hidden world known as the Catacombs of Paris, lies down the lively streets of the city, as a labyrinth of tunnels with the bones of over six million people. Although only a few tunnels are open for public exposure, the whole catacomb covers a vast area, stretching over approximately 280 kilometres.
The Paris Catacombs was originally built in the 18th century to address the city's overflowing cemeteries, and since then this underground ossuary has become one of Paris's most haunting attractions. If you are looking for a spooky experience, Paris Catacombs will offer you a glimpse into the past through special guided tours that dive into the history of revolutions and plagues.
In the narrow corridors, surrounded by bones and skulls, the silence is interrupted only by the echo of footsteps."

Jagannath University's ""Quantum Voyager"" team has emerged as the champion in the Dhaka Division of the ""NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024"" competition, organised by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The results for the Bangladesh segment of the NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon were announced yesterday at the American International University Bangladesh (AIUB) and online simultaneously. Quantum Voyager secured the championship title for the Dhaka division.
The team from Jagannath University developed an app designed to track satellites. The app sends notifications to users when a satellite passes over a specified location, allowing users to easily download and analyze data from satellites like Landsat for various purposes.
The team members -- Muammar Tajwar Asfi, Nahid Raihan, Jahangir Hossain, Farhan Masud Sohag, and Yousuf Hasan Sifat -- are all students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the university.
Reflecting on this achievement, Muammar Tajwar said, ""This was our first time participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge, and it has been a completely new experience for us. From the very beginning, we had a strong desire to achieve something remarkable. Honestly, we never expected to become champions in the Dhaka division, which is the most competitive. We dedicate this victory to the CSE department of Jagannath University. Our next goal is to become the global champion of the NASA Space Apps 2024, and now we are more confident than ever that we can achieve this through hard work.""
The NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon seeks to find innovative solutions to global problems. Alongside Dhaka, students from Chattogram, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barishal, Rangpur, Mymensingh, and Cumilla also participated in the Bangladesh segment of the competition.
A total of 500 projects from across the country were selected to compete, with the top 50 projects competing directly in Dhaka, while the remaining 450 were evaluated online during the two-day NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 Hackathon.

Project AgriSage Tech by Rashedul Arefin Ifty from Bangladesh secured the 1st runner-up position at the 12th IEEE Region 10 (Asia-Pacific Region) - Humanitarian Technology Conference 2024 Innovation Challenge held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on October 1. This innovation challenge is a project-based competition designed for IEEE – Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers – students all over the Asia-Pacific region to share their ideas empowering humans with sustainable growth and development.
Rashedul Arefin Ifty, a student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), was the sole participant from Bangladesh who advanced through the finals as one of the top three finalists from more than 500 applicants and over 75 accepted projects from all over the ten IEEE Asia-Pacific regions. His AgriSage Tech empowers farmers with weather prediction capabilities, assists in determining proper land use for crop cultivation, and helps predict appropriate harvest periods through a mobile app.
The app combines machine learning algorithms to predict weather and is one of the first of its kind to use machine learning technology in agriculture. The project is still a prototype and when completed, it will provide farmers with technology to plan their crop cultivation according to the weather. Drastic changes in weather can also be easily predicted and preventive measures can be taken accordingly before natural calamities.

Imagine graduating with a degree, only to find the doors of the job market firmly closed. This is the harsh reality of youth unemployment – a global crisis affecting millions of young people. In Bangladesh, this challenge is particularly pressing, creating a generation with untapped potential.
""The curriculum was outdated, focusing more on memorisation than practical skills. Job prospects were slim, with only one person from my batch landing a relevant job,"" shared Turjo Barman, a former Computer Engineering student at Daffodil Polytechnic Institute. His experience reflects the struggle many young graduates are facing these days.
Global youth unemployment figures for 2024 stood at an estimated 67.7 million individuals between the ages of 15 and 24, with emerging economies experiencing disproportionately higher rates. A report on the World Employment and Social Outlook Trends 2024 by the International Labour Organization (ILO) states that youth unemployment rates are nearly 3.5 times higher than those of adults.
A session at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2024, titled ""Generation Stagnation: Tackling Youth Unemployment"", highlights the disparity between those who have access to quality education and strong professional networks and those who do not. As per the report, the job market favours those from privileged backgrounds with access to quality education and strong professional networks.
Students in Bangladesh face a much more difficult reality as not everyone has equal access to opportunities and resources. This creates a barrier for students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds who struggle to find meaningful employment. To make matters worse, many students are forced to leave their education early to work and support their families.
But could technical and vocational education and training (TVET) offer a viable solution to this crisis?
The Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) 2022 Bangladesh Education Statistics report highlights the existence of 7,819 TVET institutions across Bangladesh – 691 public and 7,128 private institutions. Together, these institutions serve over 1.22 million students, but the urban-rural divide is clear. About 60.1 percent of TVET institutions are located in urban areas, and 68.7 percent of students come from cities, while rural students make up only 31.3 percent of the total enrolment. Regions like Rajshahi have the most TVET institutions, while areas like Sylhet lag behind.
Despite the availability of TVET programmes, international organisations like the European Union and World Bank, which fund skill development programmes in Bangladesh, face challenges in ensuring that these programmes meet global industry standards.
Lotte Kejser, Chief Technical Advisor of the Skills 21 project at the ILO says, ""There is insufficient relevance [of the programmes] to the industry in Bangladesh and abroad. In Bangladesh, practical skills training makes up less than 10 percent of the total training hours in TVET programmes, compared to similar programmes in Northern Europe. Most TVET programmes in Bangladesh do not include work-based training or apprenticeships.""
Lotte suggests that international organisations can better support TVET programmes in Bangladesh by familiarising the government and industry with global best practices. This would enhance the relevance of TVET programmes and encourage a greater focus on practical skills.
However, students enrolled in TVET programs typically face challenges, such as needing to attain specific certification levels before securing paid employment, which limits their earning potential during training. While this is the norm, institutions like UCEP – Underprivileged Children's Educational Programme – Bangladesh offer a distinctive model where students can both learn and earn.
""There is no alternative to technical and vocational education and training to turn the country's vast workforce into skilled human resources,"" emphasised Md Abdul Karim, Executive Director, UCEP Bangladesh.
He adds, ""UCEP Bangladesh is playing a tremendous role among the NGOs in expanding technical education and transforming skilled human resources in Bangladesh.""
Another challenge facing TVET is the underrepresentation of women. According to BANBEIS, male students significantly outnumber their female counterparts, with only 333,409 women enrolled in technical and vocational institutes compared to 895,794 men. Deep-rooted gender stereotypes, limited access to quality education, and societal expectations discourage many girls from pursuing TVET careers. Economic pressures, such as early marriage and lack of childcare, further widen the gender gap.
Moreover, the quality of TVET education in Bangladesh depends heavily on the availability of skilled teachers. With more than 55,304 teachers across public and private TVET institutions, the need for ongoing professional development is critical.
Md Quamruzzaman, Teacher and Principal of the Manikganj Government Technical School and College said, ""We must implement mandatory professional development programs focusing on emerging 4IR – Fourth Industrial Revolution – technologies and industry trends to ensure TVET teachers are well-prepared. There is also a high need for online platforms that allow teachers to access courses on the latest technical advancements and teaching methodologies at their convenience.""
He urges, ""Creating a pool of master trainers and the strengthening of industry collaborations is necessary to elevate the quality of education and better align with labour market demands.""
Given these challenges, how can TVET evolve to meet the demands of today's job market?
A significant opportunity to enhance TVET quality and build stronger industry engagement lies in upgrading and expanding practical skills training. Public sector TVET centres alone lack the capacity and resources to provide the up-to-date practical skills and advanced technology required for modern industries.
For example, culinary practices serve as an excellent form of vocational training, offering practical skills that are essential in today's global job market. Mst Kashmiri Sultana, Senior Lecturer of Tourism and Hospitality Management at UPDATE College and Institute, and Certified Trainer and Assessor, National Skills Development Authority (NSDA) and Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB), said, ""Food-related subjects like hospitality, tourism, and culinary courses are in high demand globally, providing opportunities for those who may not pursue full-time degrees and are not from economically sound backgrounds. A diploma in culinary arts can give them valuable skills, enabling them to secure jobs and earn an income.""
She further added, ""Culinary education offers both theoretical knowledge and industry training, preparing individuals to follow industry standards and even pursue entrepreneurship for a fulfilling career.""
To realise the full potential of TVET, collaboration between the public and private sectors is crucial. As Lotte Kejser points out, countries like Germany and Belgium successfully integrate work-based training with theoretical education, a model Bangladesh could follow. Private sector involvement in practical skills training would ensure that TVET graduates are better prepared for the modern workforce.
As Bangladesh struggles with high youth unemployment rates, enhancing the TVET and skill development system holds the key. The answer lies in the choices we make today – decisions that could either drive industrial growth and economic transformation or leave a generation behind.

Campus sat down with him in an interview where he reflected on the international programmes offered by Universal College Bangladesh (UCB) in collaboration with LSE-UoL, the state of higher education in Bangladesh, and where UCB and LSE fit in within the existing framework.
Campus (C):Can you elaborate on the collaboration between the London School of Economics (LSE) and Universal College Bangladesh (UCB), and its impact on higher education accessibility in Bangladesh?
Dr James Abdey (J): One of LSE's current strategic objectives is to educate for global impact. The UoL programme is LSE's way to reach a far greater number of students at the undergraduate level than we could ever hope to teach exclusively in London. The LSE campus itself has about four thousand students but through the programmes, we have about 10,000 globally. All of them are studying at recognised teaching centres, of which UCB is the only one in Bangladesh. We are very passionate about the programmes because they give students the opportunity to pursue an LSE-designed degree at a far lower cost as opposed to studying in London. Despite it being a great city, London isn't cheap. You're also having to pay a higher amount as an international student and the costs are prohibitive for many. Having UCB here in Bangladesh allows students to experience an LSE curriculum closer to home at a much lower cost and enables them to graduate with an LSE degree. It could benefit them in a number of ways, perhaps in pursuing postgraduate studies abroad or even in terms of employment.
C: What advantages can students gain by studying the LSE curricula in Bangladesh instead of directly moving abroad?
J: The academic rigour of LSE courses underlies the value of the academic degree certificates which the students are awarded. These, of course, are highly valued by employers all across the world. I always tell prospective students that not all degrees are equal. It varies depending on the degree-awarding institution, how well regarded that is, the academic content within the degree, and also how they're assessed. All of the students at UCB will sit for exams that LSE academics prepare. While students sit for their exams locally in proctored exam hall conditions, the exams themselves are graded back by LSE-appointed examiners. So, there's a strong quality assurance process at play. I think it's important that students, parents, prospective employers, master's admission officers, and faculties have confidence in the academic rigour of the programmes which reinforces the value of the degree.
C: How does the Certificate of Higher Education in Social Science (CHESS) programme bridge the gap for HSC graduates aiming to enrol in LSE programmes?
J: We operate in many countries around the world where the school education system varies a great deal. So, prospective students come in with different levels of qualifications – some of whom don't immediately meet the standard entry criteria. Rather than outright rejecting them, we want to offer an alternative pathway. CHESS is essentially year one of the three-year degree. If you're doing standard degree entry, you're already in the degree. Whereas for CHESS, to progress to year two, you need to attain a minimum level of academic performance. CHESS provides more flexibility to accommodate different potential applicants' needs. It's all about reducing barriers, not creating them.
C: What career prospects and international exposure do UCB-LSE students receive during and after their studies?
J: In terms of international experience, one option available to students is the LSE summer school which involves spending some time at LSE. I believe we are the largest summer school programme of its kind. We welcomed about 6,000 students in 2024 from all over the world. If a student were to take two summer school courses at LSE, sit for the exams, and pass them, they can actually use it for credit back towards their UoL degree. If they do that, they can just take one fewer subject in the final year. As for employability, UCB has career placement schemes with six leading companies to help students get internship placements. It is a great opportunity for students to tap into. In fact, within the degree programme, we've had a much stronger focus on employability skills. There are about ten core employability skills some of which include adaptability, resilience, complex problem-solving, communication skills etc. When students study their individual modules, we identify – for each one – three of the ten skills which that module will seek to develop.
C: What steps is UCB taking to integrate LSE's rigorous academic practices while maintaining local cultural relevance?
J: We are very much a global programme. So, while the curriculum is set in London, the LSE examiners welcome more local examples. The faculty at teaching centres have complete autonomy in giving more of those examples. Our motto is to understand the causes of things. That's what LSE has always been about. I always think an examination is a student's opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the course materials. It's about their thought process and showing how they're getting to that answer which is really the hallmark of the LSE approach to teaching through these programmes.

Buet authorities have announced that students cannot be members of any political organisation, be it on campus or outside.
The move comes nearly six months after the High Court allowed student politics on the campus.
A notice issued on Saturday by the premier engineering university read, ""No student can join any political party or other organisations except for clubs or societies approved by the university.""
Student leaders have urged Buet to immediately withdraw the decision, terming it undemocratic and unconstitutional.
The Buet notice says the authorities' aim is to ensure the quality of education, proper evaluation of merit, and elevate the university's status in the international academic community.
Buet academic council at a meeting on September 21 made the decision as part of its effort to reduce political activities among students, the notice signed by Buet Registrar Forkan Uddin adds.
""Students must strictly adhere to the university ordinance, and any violations will result in appropriate disciplinary action taken as per the rules of the ordinance,"" the statement reads.
On April 1 this year, the High Court stayed the effectiveness of the university's 2019 ban on student politics.
The stay order came in response to a writ petition filed by Buet student and Chhatra League leader Imtiaz Hossain Rahim Rabbi.
On October 7, 2019, a group of Bangladesh Chhatra League men murdered a second-year student at a dormitory. Buet banned politics after that.
Contacted yesterday, Professor Al Amin Siddiqui, director of student welfare, said, ""We made the decision considering the current situation.""
No students will be allowed to be members of organisations that have any form of political involvement, he added.
""For instance, Swadhinata Chikitsak Parishad or Doctors Association of Bangladesh are not political organisations, but they have political affiliations. Our students cannot be part of such bodies.""
He said as per Section 16 of the Board of Residence and Discipline of the Buet Ordinance, students always needed permission from the Directorate of Student Welfare to be involved in a political organisation.
Talking to The Daily Star, Nasir Uddin, general secretary of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, said, ""Banning student politics is unconstitutional and undemocratic. Banned organisations will be active now. It puts many students at risk of harassment. We believe Buet students will welcome all student organisations except Chhatra League.""
Mashiur Rahman Richard, president of Bangladesh Chhatra Federation, said, ""All Buet students are voters. They must be free to support any group or opinion. The administration has interfered with their freedom. They will eventually criminalise them, which will go against the spirit of the July mass-uprising.""
Mahir Shahriar Reza, president of a faction of Chhatra Union, said, ""We think it's an autocratic decision of the administration, a violation of constitutional rights. It is a part of a scheme to depoliticise the educational institutions.""
A student of the 19th batch said, ""We strongly condemn the decision and urge the authorities to change it. Otherwise, we will go to court if necessary.""
Noted Supreme Court Lawyer ZI Khan Panna said, ""Who gave them the right to decide what a student should do or not do outside the campus?
""We got independence because of student politics. Any adult individual can harbour any ideology. It is their constitutional right. They are not above the constitution of Bangladesh.""
Anu Muhammad, former professor of economics at Jahangirnagar University, said, ""To be able to do politics and express opinions is a bare minimum democratic right of a citizen. Buet authorities are behaving like a dictator.""

MIST Blitz – the Formula student team from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST) – has made its remarkable debut in motorsport engineering. In just a few months since its formation, the team has already achieved two significant milestones: securing the first position in the qualifying quiz for Formula Bharat 2025 and also the first place in the Engineering Design Concept Resources Management (CRM) Combustion Category for the same event.
Formula Bharat is a premier student engineering competition in India, modelled after the global Formula Student series. University teams design and build small-scale formula-style race cars, competing in categories like engineering design, cost efficiency, marketability, and so on.
""MIST Blitz started out in March 2024 when five of us friends from MIST's Mechanical Engineering department started studying vehicle dynamics during our term-end break. That passion quickly led to us registering for Formula Bharat 2025, and our journey took off from there,"" says Tahmid Muntasir, the team lead of MIST Blitz.
MIST Blitz now operates with 38 dedicated members, divided into four key technical sub-teams. Tahmid Muntasir leads the suspension, steering, and brake systems team; Iram Mustavi Chowdhury and Tausif Nawaz head the chassis and aerodynamics team; Sakin Islam leads the powertrain team, and Adnan Shahriar oversees the electronic control systems team.
Four managerial sub-teams – management and outreach, finance, logistics, and documentation – also work alongside the technical teams to ensure smooth operations. Maliha Farhin and Nazifa Rafa lead the documentation team. The members expressed their gratitude to the Chief Patron of the team and MIST Commandant, Maj Gen Nasim Parvez, BSP, ndc, afwc, psc, and Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department Brig Gen Md Anisur Rahman, for their invaluable support. They also expressed their gratitude to Maj Md Anisur Rahman, GSO-2 of the Mechanical Engineering Department, for his mentorship, and Lecturer Shah Md Ahasan Siddique for providing resolute guidance and essential resources.
""We are proud of how this team has quickly added two feathers to our automotive crown. MIST Blitz is vital for our department, providing Mechanical Engineering students with hands-on experience, building practical skills, and collaboration which are essential foundations for future challenges in the automotive field,"" said Ahasan.
After competing in Formula Bharat 2025, scheduled at the Kari Motor Speedway, India, from January 22 to 27, 2025, MIST Blitz aims to target the Formula Student UK, hosted by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, further expanding their global presence in motorsport engineering.

The resignation of Sheikh Hasina on August 5, following widespread protests, marks a pivotal moment in Bangladesh's history. The movement, largely driven by students, led to the ousting of the former regime, but not without heavy sacrifices. Over a thousand students lost their lives and many more were wounded. At the time of writing this article, many students had still not recovered. In the chaotic aftermath, the nation witnessed widespread vandalism and disorder, with minority communities being particularly vulnerable. While all the academic institutions were closed during this period of unrest, most have welcomed their students back. However, this return to academic life must be approached with care, compassion, and a deep understanding of the trauma that students have endured.
""I think we need some time to move on from everything, we have been through a lot, mentally, and physically,"" said Anushila Siddique, an undergraduate student from North South University who actively participated in the movement.
In a newly rejuvenated country, with the winds of change blowing through every corner, it is understandable that universities, colleges, and schools want to resume operations with newfound energy. In addition, the weeks lost from the academic year have created a sense of urgency to make up for lost time. However, it is crucial to recognise that rushing into a full-scale academic schedule, complete with quizzes, term exams, and heavy workload, may not be the best approach. While the drive to move forward is commendable, the well-being of students must remain a priority. The academic pressure of a typical school year, if reintroduced too quickly, could overwhelm students who are still grappling with the emotional and psychological aftermath of recent events.
A more measured approach will allow students to re-engage with their coursework without feeling burdened by expectations. Recognising this is essential for educators and administrators. If the well-being of the students is not accounted for, it could negatively impact their academic performance, resulting in lower grades than expected.
Simin Sorowar, an undergraduate student at BRAC University, shared her concerns about the state of her peers, ""Many of my classmates are still physically injured, and countless others are mentally disturbed. The violence that happened on our university premises has had an effect on all of us. Even those who couldn't join the protests in person but were closely involved online are still struggling. It's clear that most of us are not mentally equipped to dive back into our studies just yet, let alone sit for exams.""
Nubah Nanziba, a student at Dhaka University, expressed her concerns about returning to classes, ""I'm not sure how much our safety can be guaranteed, as the political situation in the country is still quite volatile. Personally, I'll be extra cautious because there's always the fear that something could go wrong. While it's reassuring that we can now speak openly about our political views, there are troubling rumours about certain people enforcing rules, and the thought of potentially facing that when I return to campus is really frightening.""
Farhan*, who is currently an undergraduate student at a private university, shared, ""Many of us are excited to go back to university with a renewed sense of freedom and happiness, but it cannot be forgotten that a lot of our peers have been injured, educational institutions should take into account students' mental and physical health before starting academic activities in full swing.''
As academic institutions reopen, there is a pressing need for a shift in mindset. Students must be given time to process what they have experienced and heal before they can be expected to fully re-engage with their studies. Educators and administrators have to play a crucial role in this process. Understanding and empathy must be at the forefront of all their decisions, rather than rigid adherence to academic schedules. Additionally, mental health resources should be made readily accessible, and seeking help should be encouraged.
""It's crucial that universities step up and provide the support we need during this time. Many of us are still dealing with physical injuries and mental trauma. With the right care and understanding, we will be better prepared to succeed academically and achieve better results,"" added Simin.
Labib Rahman*, an undergraduate student at Rajshahi University, shared his hopes for reopening academic institutions, ""I want the return to be smooth and thoughtful, not rushed. It's important that universities focus on creating a safe and supportive environment, where students can take their time to adjust. There also needs to be a serious effort to put an end to aggressive student politics on campus, so we can finally feel safe and focus on our education without the constant fear of violence or unrest.""
The process of rebuilding Bangladesh, including its academic institutions, will take time. Rushing this process could do more harm than good. Recovering from the recent turmoil is not a journey that students should navigate alone. A supportive academic community, built on mutual care and understanding, is essential for fostering healing and resilience.

Apple Intelligence, the tech giant's next big innovation for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, is almost here—and it's expected to change how we interact with these devices. But when exactly will it arrive?
According to Mark Gurman, a well-known Apple analyst from Bloomberg News, the update is rumoured to begin its rollout onMonday, October 28. Gurman broke the news in his 'Power On' newsletter, stating that iOS 18.1 will bring the first set of Apple Intelligence features to users.
Initially, Apple had hinted at an earlier, mid-October launch foriOS 18.1. However, the company has pushed back the release to ensure a smoother rollout, suggests Gurman, adding that the extra time will be used to iron out bugs and ensure Apple's AI cloud servers can handle the surge in traffic when millions of users start updating their devices.
This means new iPhone owners—particularly those with the brand-new iPhone 16 series, or the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models, will need to wait a few more weeks to try outApple Intelligence.
However, please keep in mind that October 28 is a rumoured release date only, andhas not been officially confirmed by Appleat the time of writing.
The first round of features in iOS 18.1 will focus on enhancing user experience with tools designed to make daily tasks easier, states a report by the Apple-based news platform 9to5Mac. The updated iOS will include improvements in writing assistance, an updated interface for Siri, and smarter ways to manage notifications. Users will also see new features in the Photos app, like personalised memory creation and tools to clean up their photo libraries,  states 9to5Mac.
However, at launch, these features will be available only to US English users. To access them, users will need to ensure their device language and Siri settings are both set to US English. For other English-speaking regions like the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, Apple Intelligence is expected to arrive by December 2024.
Though the first wave of Apple Intelligence is exciting, it's just the beginning. According to the 9to5Mac report, the real game-changers in Apple Intelligence are scheduled to roll out in December 2024 with iOS 18.2, which will introduce a deeper integration with ChatGPT, personalised emoji creation, and a new Image Playground feature for enhanced creativity. Following that, early 2025 will bring the full Siri upgrade with either iOS 18.3 or 18.4, states the report.

Samsung Electronics has issued an apology to its investors after revealing worse-than-expected revenue and profit forecasts, according to a recent report by Bloomberg News. The company acknowledged that it is struggling to maintain its technological competitiveness, especially in the fast-growing field of artificial intelligence (AI).
In an unusually candid statement, Jun Young-hyun, newly appointed head of Samsung's semiconductor division, admitted that the company is under significant pressure due to its recent underperformance, states the Bloomberg report. ""Concerns have arisen about our fundamental technological competitiveness and the company's future,"" said Jun, emphasising the urgency to overhaul the organisation. Despite a surge in global demand for AI-related chips, Samsung is struggling to capitalise on this opportunity, he said.
The apology comes as Samsung reported a third-quarter profit forecast of 9.1 trillion won ($6.8 billion), a substantial 274.5% increase from the same period last year but still falling short of market expectations. This profit, while impressive, reflects the company's struggle to fully leverage the boom in demand for AI server chips. The results also represented a 13% decline from the previous quarter.
One of the core issues Samsung is facing is its lag in producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential for AI training processors, particularly those used by Nvidia, explains the Bloomberg report. Competitor SK Hynix has pulled ahead in this arena, securing a dominant position in the market for these critical chips. Samsung has admitted to delays in delivering HBM chips, allowing SK Hynix to gain the upper hand in this lucrative segment.
Industry experts, such as Kim Dae-jong from Sejong University in Seoul, suggest that Samsung's loss of key employees to SK Hynix has exacerbated the issue, contributing to the company's declining performance in this area. The company now faces a ""grave situation,"" with its stock down nearly 30% over the past six months.
As part of its response to these challenges, Samsung is planning mass layoffs across its Asian operations. While described as routine, reports suggest that these cuts could affect as much as 10% to 30% of the overseas workforce in certain divisions. The company has also hinted at plans to reassess and potentially revamp its workplace culture to address internal inefficiencies and improve overall performance.
""We will make the serious situation we are currently facing an opportunity for a resurgence,"" Samsung stated in an official statement, promising that management would take swift and decisive action to navigate through the crisis.
Despite the underwhelming profit guidance, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Samsung's future. Jene Park, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, noted that while Samsung is facing challenges in the memory chip sector, the company still plays a crucial role in the global supply chain, which may prevent any drastic sales or profit declines in the near term.
Samsung has projected a 17.2% increase in sales for the third quarter, reaching 79 trillion won ($59 billion). However, the company's ability to regain its competitive edge, particularly in the high-bandwidth memory chip market, will be critical to its future success.

On the morning of August 4, social media was abuzz with the #reversebraindrainbd trend. Bangladeshi expatriates, many of whom had long left the country in search of better opportunities abroad, began to speak of returning home. They envisioned contributing to the reconstruction of a nation on the verge of new possibilities. The hashtag went viral, igniting conversations about what it would take for skilled professionals to come back and offer their expertise. It was a moment of collective hope—a window into what Bangladesh could become if its brightest minds returned to build the future they had always dreamed of.
But now, months later, it appears that the initial momentum has faded. The conversation seems to have stalled, and we are yet to see a tangible wave of skilled expatriates returning home to rebuild alongside us. What happened? Was the #reversebraindrainbd just another fleeting social media trend, or is it still possible to turn this vision into reality?
'Brain drain' is a term developing nations like Bangladesh are all too familiar with. For decades, we have watched as our best and brightest—engineers, doctors, entrepreneurs—have left for countries with better employment opportunities, higher salaries, and more stable political environments. The 'brain drain' has cost us dearly, with the country losing not just skilled professionals but also the intellectual capital needed to foster innovation and growth.
In contrast, 'reverse brain drain' refers to the return of these expatriates to their homeland. It is a phenomenon driven by various factors: visa expirations, family commitments, or, in some cases, the desire to make a difference in one's own country. The promise of 'reverse brain drain' suggests a future where skilled individuals return to invest in their homeland, bringing with them the knowledge, experience, and global networks they have gained abroad. But the question remains: are we truly ready to bring them back?
Read moreCan we break free from the brain drain cycle?One of the central narratives driving the #reversebraindrainbd movement was patriotism. Many expatriates voiced a sense of duty to return home after the recent revolution. The message was clear: the time had come to build the nation we had all dreamed of—a Bangladesh that stood tall, free from corruption and political oppression, where opportunities for growth were abundant.But while patriotism can be a strong motivator, it alone is not enough. For most expatriates, practical considerations weigh far more heavily than patriotic sentiment. After years of building successful careers abroad, the decision to return is not made lightly. Questions of job security, income stability, quality of life, and career growth are at the forefront of their minds. Many of them now wonder if Bangladesh can offer them the same opportunities they have grown accustomed to abroad, or if they will find themselves in a country still grappling with the same old challenges: bureaucracy, corruption, and economic uncertainty. Patriotism may ignite the desire to return, but it is the practical realities of day-to-day life that will ultimately determine whether these skilled professionals decide to make Bangladesh their permanent home again.We need to ask ourselves: are we truly prepared to welcome these skilled expatriates back? The reality is that the infrastructure needed to support their return may not yet be in place. While the fall of the regime has opened new doors for political freedom, we still need to address the systemic issues that have long plagued the country. We have made significant strides in development over the past decade, but we cannot ignore the fact that certain sectors remain underdeveloped. For many expats, the decision to return will hinge on whether they can find meaningful employment or create their own opportunities in a relatively stable and supportive environment. Do we have the frameworks in place to support innovation? Is the economy ready to absorb and retain top talent? These are questions we must answer if we want to turn the #reversebraindrainbd trend into a tangible reality. It is not enough to simply call for people to come home—we must actively work to create an environment where they can thrive.Conversely, it must be understood that there would only be a few ready-made opportunities waiting for these people in Bangladesh. The beauty of our current situation is that there is potential for virtually unlimited opportunities to create something new. A generation of young people, many of whom once dreamed of leaving Bangladesh, have stayed to fight for the country's future and are now actively working to rebuild the nation from the ground up. They have proven that change is possible, but they cannot do it alone from here. Our expatriates can make a difference—but not by waiting for perfect opportunities to fall into their laps. Instead, they must come back and create those opportunities themselves. The fall of the regime has cleared the way for innovation and new ideas. Whether it is starting a new business, launching a tech startup, or contributing to social welfare projects, now is the time for those with skills and experience to bring their ideas to life in Bangladesh.We need our expatriates to return—not out of a sense of obligation or guilt, but because they see the potential in what we are building together. A nation is only as strong as the collective will of its people, both at home and abroad. And as we work to rebuild Bangladesh, we must do so with the knowledge that the challenges ahead are not insurmountable. It is time now to show the world what we are capable of when we come together to build something better.To everyone who posted on social media about returning, I say this: now is the time to act. There are no ready-made opportunities, but there are endless possibilities waiting for those bold enough to create them. Come back, and let us build our dream nation together.

In today's fast-paced, always-on work culture, job burnout has become increasingly common. The relentless pursuit to constantly perform at a satisfactory level can often blur the lines between work and personal life. Burnouts aren't just about feeling tired or stressed, to many, it's a chronic state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. Here are the top five indicators that you may be experiencing burnout in your professional life.
The most obvious sign of burnout, chronic exhaustion persists even after a long rest, making it difficult to get through daily tasks. You may wake up feeling just as tired as when you went to bed, and even simple activities can feel overwhelmingly difficult. This type of exhaustion goes beyond physical tiredness; it also impacts your mental and emotional energy, leaving you feeling drained and unmotivated.
Tasks that once came easily now seem insurmountable, and you may find yourself missing deadlines or struggling to keep up with basic responsibilities. Concentration and decision-making become difficult, leading to mistakes or a lack of creativity. Despite working longer hours to try to catch up, it often feels like you are falling further behind, which only adds to the pre-existing frustration and helplessness.
You may feel detached from your work, losing the passion or enthusiasm you once had. This often manifests as cynicism or apathy—you simply stop caring. Work feels like a chore rather than something that challenges or excites you. Emotional detachment can extend to your relationships with coworkers, where you might avoid social interactions or disengage from teamwork.
When you are burned out, your emotional tolerance decreases, leading to heightened irritability and frustration. Minor setbacks or annoyances that you would normally brush off can now trigger strong emotional reactions. You may find yourself snapping at colleagues, friends, or family members for small issues, or feeling overwhelmed by problems that aren't actually that big. This emotional volatility can strain your relationships and create tension both in and out of the workplace.
Common physical symptoms of burnout include headaches, muscle tension, digestive problems, and sleep disturbances. You might find it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep, and even when you do rest, it doesn't feel like you have had enough. Chronic stress can also weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to colds and other illnesses. These physical symptoms are your body's way of signalling that the stress has reached a critical level.

Criminal networks in Southeast Asia are extensively using the messaging app Telegram to facilitate large-scale illegal operations, according to a report released by the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
Hacked data including credit card details, passwords and browser history are openly traded on a vast scale on the app which has sprawling channels with little moderation, the report said.
Tools used for cybercrime, including so-called deepfake software designed for fraud, and data-stealing malware are also widely sold, while unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges offer money laundering services, according to the report.
""We move 3 million USDT stolen from overseas per day,"" the report quoted one ad as saying in Chinese.
There is ""strong evidence of underground data markets moving to Telegram and vendors actively looking to target transnational organised crime groups based in Southeast Asia,"" the report said.
Southeast Asia has emerged as a major hub for a multibillion-dollar industry that targets victims across the world with fraudulent schemes. Many are Chinese syndicates that operate from fortified compounds staffed by trafficked workers. The industry generates between $27.4 billion to $36.5 billion annually, UNODC said.
Russian-born Durov was arrested in Paris in August and charged with allowing criminal activity on the platform including the spread of sexual images of children. The move has put the spotlight on the criminal liability of app providers and also triggered debate on where freedom of speech ends and enforcement of the law begins.
Telegram, which has close to 1 billion users, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Following his arrest, Durov, who is currently out on bail, said the app would hand over users' IP addresses and phone numbers to authorities making legal requests. He also said the app would remove some features that have been abused for illegal activity.
Benedikt Hofmann, UNODC's deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said the app was an easily navigable environment for criminals. ""For consumers, this means their data is at a higher risk of being fed into scams or other criminal activity than ever before,"" he told Reuters.
The report said the sheer scale of the profits earned by criminal groups in the region had required them to innovate, adding they had integrated new business models and technologies including malware, generative artificial intelligence and deepfakes into their operations.
UNODC said it had identified more than 10 deepfake software service providers ""specifically targeting criminal groups involved in cyber-enabled fraud in Southeast Asia"".
Elsewhere in Asia, police in South Korea - estimated to be the country most targeted by deepfake pornography - have reportedly launched an investigation into Telegram that will look at whether it abets online sex crimes.
Reuters also reported last month that a hacker had used chatbots on Telegram to leak the data of top Indian insurer Star Health, prompting the insurer to sue the platform.
Using the chatbots, Reuters was able to download policy and claims documents featuring names, phone numbers, addresses, tax details, copies of ID cards, test results and medical diagnoses.

A US judge on Monday ordered Google to open its Android smartphone operating system to rival app stores, in a fresh legal setback for the tech giant.
The order is the result of Google's defeat in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games, where a California jury decided that Google wields illegal monopoly power through its Android Play store.
The San Francisco jury in December took just a few hours to decide against Google, finding that the company had embarked on various illegal strategies to maintain its app store monopoly on Android phones.
The order, which Google is appealing, follows a similar setback in August when a different judge found that Google's world-leading search engine was also an illegal monopoly.
Google is also facing an antitrust lawsuit in a third federal case in Virginia over its dominance of online advertising.
Under the Epic Games order, for the next three years Google will be prohibited from engaging in several practices that were deemed anticompetitive by the jury in the landmark case.
These prohibitions include revenue sharing with potential competitors and requirements that developers launch apps exclusively on the Play Store.
The judge has also ordered the creation of a three-person Technical Committee to oversee the implementation of the changes and resolve any disputes that may arise.
This injunction represents a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the Android app ecosystem and could reshape the mobile app landscape in the coming years.
Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney urged companies to seize this opportunity ""to build a vibrant and competitive Android ecosystem with such critical mass that Google can't stop it.""
He also underlined that the changes would only be applicable in the US, but pledged that ""the legal and regulatory battle will continue around the world.""
Google appeals
Google said it would appeal the injunction and also demand that it be set aside pending the outcome of its continued legal challenge.
The judge said the order was effective November 1, with some provisions given until July 1 to be implemented.
""We will keep advocating for what is best for developers, device manufacturers and the billions of Android users around the world,"" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's regulatory affairs vice president.
Phones running on the Android operating system have about a 70 percent share of the world's smartphone market.
Smartphone companies can install the Android app for free under the condition that the Play app store remains on the home page and that other Google offers are pre-installed.
The jury found that Google worked illegally to make sure that the Google Play app store was the only conduit for making payments to third party apps such as Fortnite and other games.
A sizable chunk of app store revenue comes from video games, and Epic Games has long sought to have payments for its mobile games, such as Fortnite, take place outside the Google or Apple app stores that take commissions as high as 30 percent.
Epic mostly lost a similar case against Apple, where a different US judge largely ruled in favor of the iPhone-maker.
Apple and Google regularly argue that their app shop commissions are industry-standard, and that they pay for benefits such as reach, transaction security and ferreting out malware.
Google also argued that the arrangement with smartphone makers helped Android-run devices better compete against Apple's iPhone.
But the trial exposed that Google rakes in tens of billions of dollars of revenue through the app store.
In order to preserve its one-stop-shop for apps, Google paid smartphone makers a cut of its revenue in return for the Play store remaining the exclusive gateway.

Waymo, the autonomous driving technology company owned by Google parent Alphabet, is teaming up with South Korean automaker Hyundai to bring electric vehicles to its growing robotaxi fleet in the US.
According to a recent Reuters report, the partnership will see Hyundai's IONIQ 5 SUVs, manufactured in Georgia, equipped with Waymo's autonomous technology. On-road testing for these vehicles is set to begin by late 2025.
Currently, Waymo operates around 700 vehicles and remains the only US company offering fully autonomous robotaxi rides to paying customers, as per Reuters. The partnership comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk is expected to reveal plans for his own robotaxi service, including a ride-hailing platform where Tesla owners could list their cars when not in use.
Waymo's existing fleet includes I-PACE vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover and Zeekr EVs from China's Geely. The addition of Hyundai vehicles will expand, not replace, its current range, states Reuters. This year, Waymo opened up its service to the general public in San Francisco, expanded in Phoenix, and extended operations to Los Angeles and the San Francisco Peninsula.
Hyundai's global COO, Jose Munoz, expressed excitement about the collaboration, noting that their manufacturing facility is preparing to deliver a substantial number of vehicles to support Waymo's expansion. Both companies are exploring further opportunities for future projects.
Despite regulatory challenges and scepticism surrounding autonomous vehicles, Alphabet remains committed, with plans for a $5 billion multi-year investment in Waymo. In August 2024, Waymo reported doubling its paid rides to 100,000 per week in just three months, further states the report.

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionise industries from banking to content creation, it has also begun to influence scientific research, raising the question: Could AI one day win a Nobel Prize? While this may seem far-fetched today, a recent report by AFP highlights how researchers and scientists are working to develop AI systems potentially worthy of such recognition in the future.
In 2021, Japanese scientist Hiroaki Kitano proposed the 'Nobel Turing Challenge', urging researchers to create an AI capable of winning a Nobel Prize by 2050. Although it's an ambitious goal, some progress is already visible.
In 2009, a team led by Ross King, a professor of machine intelligence at Chalmers University in Sweden, introduced 'Robot Scientist Adam'—the first machine to make scientific discoveries on its own. Adam was designed to generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and analyze the results, all without human intervention. Adam's discoveries, although modest, were significant, including identifying unknown functions of genes in yeast. A follow-up AI, 'Eve', has focused on drug research, particularly for malaria.
Despite these advancements, AI systems today aren't Nobel-ready. According to King, while robot scientists can work tirelessly and record every detail, they lack the intelligence to grasp the broader significance of their findings, a key requirement for high-level scientific breakthroughs.
One of AI's most notable achievements in science so far is AlphaFold, an AI model developed by Google DeepMind, which predicts the 3D structures of proteins with incredible accuracy—something humans couldn't achieve alone. This tool is revolutionising biology, aiding research into diseases and drug development.
Yet, as Inga Strumke, a professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, points out, AlphaFold is better at solving problems than explaining them. AI can provide answers but struggles to offer scientific insight, which is crucial for Nobel-worthy work, suggests the AFP report.
While AI isn't close to winning a Nobel on its own, it's likely to assist in future prize-winning discoveries. Experts like David Pendlebury, who tracks Nobel trends, predict AI will soon play a key role in Nobel-recognised research. Google DeepMind's work with AlphaFold, for instance, has already earned its creators prestigious awards, and they're among the top contenders for a Nobel Prize in the near future.
AI is not yet capable of the deep understanding required to win a Nobel Prize independently, but it's already changing the way science is conducted, states the AFP report. As AI becomes more advanced, it will undoubtedly contribute to significant breakthroughs, potentially bringing it closer to Nobel recognition within the next decade.

Students of Jahangirnagar University yesterday blocked Dhaka-Aricha highway protesting the killing of an RMG worker during Monday's clash.
Kawsar Ahmed Khan, 26, a sewing machine operator at Mango Tex factory, was shot dead during the clash between protesting workers and law enforcers in Ashulia of Savar on Monday.
JU students took position in front of the university's entrance on the highway around 1:15pm and left the place 45 minutes later.
The death of a worker at the hands of state forces is unacceptable, as workers, who also died during the student-people movement which toppled Sheikh Hasina's regime, are an integral part of the ""New Bangladesh"", said Riddha Anindya Ganguly, general secretary of the Bangladesh Students' Union's JU unit.
BSU also held a protest rally at the base of the Raju memorial sculpture in DU yesterday.
""If a government formed through bloodshed cannot ensure wages for workers like Kawsar and instead shoots them, no amount of reforms will make a difference,"" said the organisation's DU unit president Meghmallar Bosu.

Workers of Birds Group are continuing their demonstration blocking Nabinagar-Chandra highway for the second consecutive day today, causing a 15-kilometre traffic jam on the road.
Following the blockade, the traffic congestion now spread from Nabinagar to Jirani and from Nabinagar to BPATC on the Dhaka-Aricha highway, our Savar correspondent reports quoting Dhaka North Traffic Inspector (Admin) Hossain Shahid Chowdhury.
The workers of Birds Group in Ashulia industrial area blocked the highway since 9:00am yesterday, demanding arrears and reopening of the factory.
However, most garment factories in the industrial belt are operational today, though workers at some factories have not joined yet, according to a source at the industrial police.
Abu Bakar Siddique, officer-in-charge (OC) of Ashulia Police Station, said that senior army officers are in contact with the factory owners to resolve the issue.
Khairul Mamun Mintu, legal affairs secretary of the Bangladesh Garments and Sweater Workers Trade Union Centre, told The Daily Star that a meeting involving the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the workers, and the owners was held at the Directorate of Factory and Institution Inspection.
According to the meeting's decision, Birds Group was supposed to pay the workers their dues yesterday, but they failed to do so.
Asked, BGMEA senior vice president Abdullah Heel Rakib today said the Birds Group owners were asked yesterday to pay the workers arrears but they would not do that yet. Birds Group owner Engineer Anwar has been hospitalised as he is sick, the official said adding that his family members' could not be reached over phone.
Of the factories which were not operational today, AR Jeans Producer Ltd in Kathgara declared a public holiday today. Also, Mango Tex Ltd in Tongabari, Setara Apparels in Jamgara, and Skyline factory remain now closed, but factories -- Mandal Knitwear, Natural Denim, and Natural Indigo are running their operations.
Birds Group on August 27 issued a notice, saying that due to the Russia-Ukraine war and the global economic downturn, it had been struggling with a lack of work.
Despite ongoing financial losses, the company attempted but failed to secure new orders, which led to the closure of several divisions, including RNR Fashions Ltd, Birds Garments Ltd, Birds Fedrex Ltd, and Birds A&Z Ltd.

I picked upThe Seven Moons of Maali Almeidaafter being bombarded by its colourful cover in one too many bookstores, and I now categorise the way I feel about war in the following manner: BeforeMaaliand AfterMaali. That's how much of an impact it has made on me—an impact only exacerbated two months later when I revisited the book following the July Uprising.
Shehan Karunatilaka's Booker Prize-winning-masterpiece is an audacious follow-up to his debut, Commonwealth Book Prize winnerChinaman(2010) (a joyous mess consisting of an alcoholic, washed-up reporter tracing the annals of pasts and presents to hunt down a great, but erstwhile, cricketer).Chinamanintroduced us to a gifted novelist who could juggle pain with humour without taking the edge off the other.The Seven Moons of Maali Almeidacemented Karunatilaka's place in history.
For Maali Almeida, life is one long poker game where one loses twice the money gained. His almost hopeless perspective is understandable: born to a Sinhalese father and Burgher mother in a country busy grappling with its own tapestry, Almeida spends his time capturing undulating violence. His pessimism is agitated by his sardonic irony: ""In all this madness, there is only one beast whose existence you doubt. And you are not thinking of God, also known as Whoever. You are thinking of that most impossible of all mythical creatures: the Honest Politician.""
The tone throughout Maali is ardent sorrow punctuated by laugh-out-loud wit, asserted strongly by the narrative of our protagonist, who has woken up to find himself dead. The afterlife he is stuck in is a mirror to a reality known too well by most of us living in Bangladesh: a wearying, sometimes-dysfunctional (and often-incompetent) bureaucracy. Ghosts, victims of the violence wrought by the Sri Lankan Civil War, stand in lines stretching time, form-in-hand, scowl-in-face. Almeida hears whispers of the dead in the wind; even in death, he does not escape opportunists, be it in the form of vengeful Marxists or voodoo-wielding Gurus (but he does escape Colombo traffic, so death has its perks).
Once he is dead, he is faced with an ultimatum: move on to the Other Side, or be stuck in the In Between forever, a decision he must make in Seven Moons (a poetic way to say he has a week). The dilemma lies in the fact that there's some extremely valuable photographs he wants to expose to the world, but the only way to do so is to communicate with the two people who know him best. Enter, Maali's British-resident girlfriend Jaki, and her political-nepo-baby cousin (and Maali's illicit, on-off boyfriend) DD, neither of whom has a clue that Maali is dead.
Maali's motivations are a projection of what Karunatilaka wants to communicate about war: about the lingering trauma that remains, of what the dead would say if they could speak. This is what forms the crux of the story. He races against time to get to Jaki and DD, braving demons and his own mistakes. It's a sobering reflection of the cruelty one can leave behind, even when you're not in the middle of it all.
Almeida's roving eye sears everything in its past with its critical outlook, and the worst is reserved for himself. He tells us details of his life in abundance, no graphic detail spared. The island-wide calamity that befalls this book spares nobody (""The one good thing you can say about a bomb is that it isn't racist or sexist or concerned about class."") and the skeletons are recorded by Almeida himself.
This is why, when he says the worst is yet to come, it feels like he's telling the future: the controversial 2009 dénouement of the Lankan Civil War, the uprising that would see civilians take over the President's house. The way we faced a similar reckoning ourselves, with the ousting of our own government and even way of life. But despite the agony, despite the girlfriends related to boyfriends, despite the poker marathons and missing limbs, Almeida doesn't lose sight of what the reader does. That ruthless pragmatism needs an equally reckless hope. That courage is what drives us forward. Yes, the journey in getting there is nothing short of hell (sometimes, literally), but he says it best himself: ""the kindest thing you can say about life. It's not nothing.""

As our calendars flip to October, often reckoned as a transition period between summer and the crisp fall season, it becomes fairly hard to restrain ourselves from back-to-back reruns ofGilmore GirlsandThe Secret History. This list embraces the imminent autumn season with open arms and five cosy, feel-good books.
The Pumpkin Spice Cafe (Dream Harbor #1)
Laurie Gilmore
One More Chapter, 2023
Speaking of Gilmore Girls, the first addition to our list is a hearty romantic novel by Laurie Gilmore. This book is a written rendition of Stars Hollow itself—starting from the quirky characters to its eternally golden atmosphere.
When Jeanie's aunt unexpectedly leaves her the cherished Pumpkin Spice Café in the quaint town of Dream Harbor, she seizes the opportunity to escape her monotonous desk job and kick off afresh. However, a local farmer by the name of Logan puts all her plans to waste. Logan, a cranky old-time resident of Dream Harbor, does everything in his power to avoid the town's constant gossip, but the new owner of the town's cafe sends his life into complete disruption. Although her upbeat nature grates on his nerves, there is something about her that he cannot quite ignore, no matter how hard he tries. For fans of the Lorelai-Luke ship, this would be the ideal pick-me-up!
In the Company of Witches (Evenfall Witches B&B #1)
Auralee Wallace
Berkley, 2021
For readers who aren't too keen on romance, perhaps a cosy mystery might be of interest. In the Company of Witches by Auralee Wallace is the tale of the Warren Witches. Thanks to their discreet use of magic, the modest and peaceful New England village of Evenfall has been blessed with wealth for four centuries. Thus far, no challenge has proven too difficult for them to handle. When Constance Graves, a notoriously difficult and argumentative local, is found dead at the bed and breakfast run by Brynn Warren and her aunts, it first appears to be a tragic accident. However, it does not take long to realise that something far darker is at play, and Aunt Nora is first on the list of prime suspects. Desperate to clear Nora's name, Brynn finds herself frustrated by the realisation that two years ago, the task might have been easier. As a witch of the dead, she has the rare ability to commune with spirits, and while the dead rarely recall the circumstances of their own passing, they often remember fragments of their lives that could provide crucial clues. Since the death of her husband, Brynn has avoided using her powers and now doubts whether she even can. Relying on her aunts' magic and her personal investigative instincts, Brynn sets out to uncover the truth. In doing so, she may also rediscover the gift she once thought she could leave behind forever.
The Other Lives of Miss Emily White
A.J. Elwood
Titan Books, 2023
If gothic, sinister literature tickles your feel-good fancy, then The Other Lives of Miss Emily White is the book for you! In 1864, Ivy is sent away from her family's farm to a crumbling boarding school, where she feels utterly alone. Shunned for her working-class roots and mourning her sister's recent death, she finds solace in Mademoiselle Emily Blanc, a graceful new teacher who nurtures her artistic talent. Ivy's admiration deepens as her relationship with Emily develops, but soon, strange rumours begin to circulate—students claim Mademoiselle Blanc can appear in two places at once, teaching in the classroom while simultaneously strolling in the garden. As a mysterious book about a teacher with a doppelgänger comes to light, Ivy's obsession with Mademoiselle Blanc spirals out of control, rendering her desperate to protect the one person she sees as her only ally.
Monojder Odvut Bari (Odvuture #1)
Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay
Ananda Publishers Private Limited, 1978
A cult classic in the realm of middle-grade Bangla literature, any book recommendation list is incomplete without a mention of Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay's Odvuture series. An eccentric cast of characters resides in Manoj's sprawling, and somewhat straggling, ancestral home. Dukkhohoron babu, the tutor, insists on teaching only with his feet propped up. Satish Bharadwaj, the family priest, pets two ghosts—Handu and Bhundu—for company. Thakurjhee, the hot-tempered aunt, is obsessed with keeping everything spotlessly clean, while Ganesh Ghoshal, the music teacher, attempts to hang himself two to three times every month. Chaos erupts, however, when Manoj's uncle discovers a revolver. As if things could not get any stranger, the bumbling detective, Baradacharan, stumbles into the scene, and the mystery of a missing prince only adds to the madness.
A Psalm for the Wild-Built (Monk and Robot #1)
Becky Chambers
Tordotcom, 2021
And lastly, tying this list off with a fantasy/sci-fi suggestion, A Psalm for the Wild-Built is a novella that digs profoundly into the quiet crevices of the human heart. The Panga robots became self-aware centuries ago, abandoned their tools, and disappeared into the woods, becoming a part of folklore and myth. One day, a tea monk's tranquil existence is upended by the unexpected arrival of a robot who has been sent to Earth to see how humanity is doing. The robot's sole objective is to ascertain answers to a specific question—""What do people need?""—and it cannot return until a satisfactory explanation is obtained. The response, however, is hardly straightforward, and the monk and the robot find themselves frequently asking each other this very question.

Happy Hourgreeted me like a warm hug. This is definitely one of the sweetest books I've read this year, and possibly one of the sweetest books I will ever read.
The book follows main characters Isa Ipley and Gala Novak along their five(ish)-month stint of trying to pay their way through summer in New York with mostly charm and wit, and occasionally some money on the side. They're subletting a room in an apartment which is wearing them thin on finances so they plan to go to the flea market and set up shop, only to go get drinks after and keep on struggling to pay rent.
Like the modern-day Lucy and Ethel duo, Gala is often a bit neurotic and gets on Isa's nerves, while Isa is more on the quieter side. Isa describes it as: ""The amount of effort that goes into appeasing that girl is absurd. I am never thanked; it's just always expected."" But that is not to say that Gala is made to be the villain of the story; there, frankly, is none. It is just a delightful tall tale of two young girls strutting about in the New York heat in their designer knock-offs. It's like if Carrie Bradshaw swapped out her closet full of Louboutins for thrifted ones, and instead of ""wondering"" away on her laptop in her big Manhattan penthouse, she gets busy selling second-hand, vintage clothes at the flea market at a profit—it is one of the best things ever.
All the chapters of the novel are written like journal entries. It is Isa's diary and we get to take a peek into their life on a handful of days every month from May to September. We follow them through their misadventures and late night, and get acquainted with Gala's delinquency fairly quickly when she smacks a beer bottle into a John-Henry's head because she is convinced that he is annoying Isa with his ""timid"" attempts at flirtation.
There is a large cast of characters that accompany the girls throughout the course of their stay in New York, but we don't always remember much about them because we don't really have to. The hero of the story is Isa and her faithful co-conspirator, Gala, and everything else is mere decoration for the plot, which itself is also very erratic. But not in a disengaged way where it does not make sense, but rather fittingly, because this is exactly what the point of view would have been like for a pair of 20-year-olds navigating their way around a city they know nothing about. One minute we're sitting next to a gold-toothed taxi driver playing a song about love and longing and next we're wondering if a fig isn't just an outside-in caterpillar.
However, one of the core foundations of the book is Isa and Gala's unrelenting friendship. This is possibly one of the most honest portrayals of female friendships I've come across, especially at 21. Their love for each other is fierce and sometimes they don't express it in the right way. They bicker and fight, but Isa knows she would not prefer anyone else's company but Gala's.
There are varied opinions when it comes to this book. Some have described it as aimless, with a sporadic plot that ultimately leads nowhere, calling it a less depressing version of Ottessa Moshfegh's novelMy Year of Rest and Relaxation(Penguin Books, 2019).
Because I remember being 11 years old and sneaking off after lights out to catch reruns ofSex and The Cityon AXN, before my mother ultimately figured it out and shooed me back to bed, the storyline of Happy Hour played into the mystique of it all for me—of New York City, and more particularly women in New York City.

On September 23, 2024, a zine-making workshop took place at Jatra Biroti, organised by Sister Library, in partnership with Her Story Foundation, Goethe Institut, and Star Books and Literature. The event brought together individuals who are passionate about learning and exploring the world of zine creation, as zines are a celebrated medium for self-expression and non-commercial publishing.
Led by Katerina Don, Curator of HerStory and Sister Library, the workshop commenced with introductions from the participants. Don then provided an overview of the history and significance of zines in contemporary culture. She showcased various examples of past zines from Sister Library's 'Pink Shelf', emphasising their roles in feminism and activism. Each zine had challenged the status quo in its own unique way. They were intimate and personal, yet also amplifying diverse voices. The topics of the zines were boundless but still highly relatable, ranging from momos and biryani to friendships and even menstruation—these zines shed light on numerous issues. These little booklets were created to convey ideas and stories that might have otherwise gone unheard in mainstream media.
Feeling inspired after going through the thought-provoking archive, participants began making their own zines. Katerina Don patiently demonstrated the basic zine-making techniques, from layout planning to folding methods—showing how a single piece of paper can be bent and creased to be beautifully transformed into a booklet with eight smaller pages. Whether it would be a standing, gallery-style zine or a traditional zine was their own choice. The participants had collectively brainstormed for a minute, closing their eyes to envision how they would like to express their thoughts and feelings onto the paper. They were then free to write, draw, cut and stick paper onto their zines in whatever ways they wished, letting their creative processes take them in whichever directions that came to mind.
Each individual engaged in their personal storytelling, tapping into several facets of their stories, opinions, and experiences. The immersive activity, along with Jatra Biroti's vibrant decorations, lighting, and ambient music, created an energetic atmosphere where ideas flowed freely. The zines, made by the participants, were undeniably an expression of raw emotions, with some participants having made art focusing on their mental health and inner turmoils. The themes varied, though, from talking about the importance of using film cameras all the way to the tale of a tree with a jinn living in it—reflecting the fascinating variety of attendees at the event, as their own perspectives shone through their artistic work.
Katerina Don then made her closing remarks. She said, ""In every event, we keep saying that the power of creation lies within you. And zines really make you realise that."" She added that, ""It can be scary, a piece of white paper is scary. But this can be shared with others. Zines are also forgiving as they can be anonymous, yet at the same time very inclusive. There's a comfort in that."" She had also mentioned that Sister Library hopes to display all the zines made from the last few workshops at a location soon.
With the event slowly reaching its end, participants bonded over their shared passion for making something personal and meaningful by showing their work to each other. Admiring one another's work and the exchange of ideas built a sense of community within the group as discussions about zine culture, art, and the challenges of self-expression took place.
Soon, as the participants started to leave, it was clear that the act of making zines had provided not only a creative outlet but also a therapeutic experience for many in the room.

There is something to be said about the innate process of otherising a person with disability, and pushing them out of the group of the 'norm' and into the group of the 'exception'. That a body can be politicised in such a manner that anything considered 'less than' or 'different from' the ideal body can be labelled as an outcast is a cultural and political practice we see everyday. Often, the disabled body is treated as an entity that is less than human, and literary portrayals of those marginalised and socially ostracised beings can sometimes attest to such social and cultural norms.
In Bapsi Sidhwa'sCracking India(originally published asIce-Candy Man, 1988)—set during the tumultuous days of 1947 Partition—the main character, Lenny, is a Parsee child who suffered from polio as an infant, and was left with certain disabilities as a result. Towards the beginning of the novel, Lenny's disability is at the forefront of the story. After a series of treatments that failed to give Lenny the degree of mobility her parents had hoped for, her doctor Colonel Bharucha suggests Lenny live a ""happy, carefree life"".
The idea that her aspirations, motivations and goals should be connected to, and weighed down by her physical disability portrays the ableist nature of the perception of disability, and thus, that the able body is superior to the disabled— giving Bharucha the power over Lenny to make important life decisions for her.Colonel Bharucha's immediate reassurance that she would be ""quite normal"" establishes and introduces us to the phenomenon of considering a person with disability to be not normal. Thus, a person with a body that is in any way different from what is considered ""whole"" and ""ideal"", is abnormal and is in the need to be ""fixed"". Moreover, Colonel Bharucha decides to restrict Lenny to a ""strain-free"" life. While consoling her parents regarding the permanence of her condition, he says she would not need to be educated, and could always get married and lead a happy life. In all of this, her disability is made to be the cause for which Lenny needs to settle, insinuating that a life with disability must be reduced to mediocrity, without the need for better things, or higher achievements.Read moreThe children of the red stormWhile a happy conjugal life without an education or a career may be a perfectly fulfilling life for some, it must be taken into consideration that Lenny had little to no agency in deciding the course of her life, and that the ones making the decision for her were neither conditioned to disability themselves, nor did they think that getting married and not receiving an education was the best course for a fulfilling life. Of course, Lenny's polio does not prevent her from receiving an education. Rather, it is the assumption that an education, or striving for more, would ""strain her nerves"", and so she should just aspire to marriage and children and be happy with that.The idea that her aspirations, motivations, and goals should be connected to and weighed down by her physical disability portrays the ableist nature of the perception of disability, and thus, that the able body is superior to the disabled—giving Bharucha the power over Lenny to make important life decisions for her.In between two of Lenny's appointments with Bharucha in the novel, Sidhwa mentions 'a happy interlude'. Here, a four year old Lenny still goes to school with her cousin, and tricks the teacher into believing it is the cousin who is with disability, thus letting Lenny play with the other children. As Lenny shouts, plays, laughs, and runs on the tips of her toes, it can be seen that she has not lost as much mobility and function as is assumed about her. Lenny is happy when she can shrug off the lopsided weight of her disability, and more precisely the weight of the fear of her disability pushed onto her by her parents.Furthermore, when the teacher asks the children which of them were 'sick', she is most likely throwing the word around mindlessly, as do so many other people, usually without disability. Lenny is not sick, she is not suffering from an illness that causes symptoms or needs immediate care or medical attention.However brief, the use of this word ""sick"" not only portrays society's likeness and willingness to bunch together people conditioned with different ailments or illnesses and people with disability under the same umbrella, but also tends to legitimise the hierarchical dichotomies (able-bodied/disabled body) of the political body, and the resulting hegemonic power of the norm over the exception, or the ideal over the less-than-ideal.It is these biases, and the ingrained sense of superiority that comes with these social constructs, that allow for an imbalance of power. After all, given the legacy of colonialism and the colonial contact, there is always an eagerness for power imbalances to form, in any group. One would always like to convert their privilege into a source of power over those that lack said privilege.Read moreThe comfort of rereading old booksTake the character of Velutha from Arundhati Roy'sThe God of Small Things(1997), for example, who is a communist and an ""untouchable"" (from a caste lower than the protagonist Ammu and her family). A carpenter hired to work in the family's factory, Velutha's life is entangled completely in his socio-political standings and is ultimately upended by his relationship with the upper caste Ammu. Even Rahel, one of Ammu's twins who loved Velutha during Sophie Mol's funeral, imagines someone painting the high domes of the church, and thinks to herself, ""someone like Velutha"" must have done it, grouping him with those of lower caste in society.In Ammu's dream in Chapter 11 of the book, Velutha is seen to only have one arm. It is also portrayed that within Ammu's dreams, his actions were restricted by his 'disability' and the consequence is described as having no impact; ""He left no footprints in sand, no ripples in water, no image in mirrors."" The choice to portray Velutha, a clearly marginalised character with a disability within his lover's dreams holds significance.The most literal way to interpret his dream-disability would be the disability as an allusion to having no agency, no instrument to carry out his wishes and will. That the absence of one hand shows that he is always subjected to a choice. He cannot have it all, even as he should be able to. It shows the nature of the choice he is subjected to as well, that he has little to no bargaining power, and it is out of his reach to rectify the situation.His dream-disability also brings into comparison the post-colonial condition of racial and ethnic discrimination and the impossible odds stacked against the disabled body.

His existence in society and in Ayemenem as an untouchable leaves little to no mark in its threads, and in the greater fabric of India, in reference to his communist protests and later, his death.Thus, through the works of Roy and Sidhwa, my argument stands—the portrayal of disability is more than what is written, and is an effective tool that allows for the reflection of the lives of those cut off and pushed away from society based on their choices and identity.In the past couple of months, Bangladesh has seen a fair share of chaos stirred within what was initially a fight for freedom, and what later turned to a desperate call for reform.

Anasru Ishwarwritten by Kazi Labonno is an impressive work of fiction, shedding light on the deepest gloom pervading the remotest corner of society. Her craftsmanship brings to the fore the pitiful lives of the cleaner community, known as ""methor"", ""dhangor"" or ""harijan"" in the Lalmonirhat district of Bangladesh, with all their agonies and social stigma, stirring the heart of the readers. The novel is a sorrowful saga of the downtrodden—the most unfortunate and neglected who are almost non-existent as human creatures.
We are informed through the narratives that the methors who clean excrement and other kinds of dirt from households and streets are looked down upon for their ""lowly""  occupation. The mainstream society avoids them, does not share food and water with them, and even prevents them from using public transport. These people live in squalor surrounded by heaps of garbage. They are treated as ""untouchables"", subjected to various insults if they violate social rules. Children do not go to school; they grow up in ignorance and neglect, with no expectations of good life and detained in abominable social injustice.
The writer has raised questions against such injustice in the book. She has tried to sensitise the issue, reminding the readers that they are also humans, deserving of all rights and respect as human beings. Even ""ishwar"" (the almighty) seems to be indifferent to them. The title of the book,Anasru Ishwarmeans ""Tearless Creator"", attaining an unusual poetic poignancy.
The novel opens with the marriage preparation of Hiralal and Jamuna. These are central characters to the novel and remain present until the last chapter. Other characters include Jahid, Nilu and Jini—a family of three that has their own journey, facing the joys and sorrows of life. Charubala Mousi, an old woman who used to be a prostitute, and Mullukkhawa, an abandoned orphan boy, are two sidelined characters but their stories are interesting enough to affect the readers' psyche with the question of existential futility.
One day, on the way to his father-in-law's house, Hiralal is thrown out of a public bus as he is identified as a methor. He sits under a tree and meditates upon his condition. He looks at the sky in search of God, who is their Creator and realises he was born as a member of the community that lives in the lowest echelon of society, in which he grew up in dire poverty. He reflects on the difference between the upbringing of a pig and him. The description that follows becomes moving.
The protagonist of the novel Jamuna, wife of Hiralal, is intelligent, sensitive and rebellious. But she becomes downcast when Madhubala, her husband's deaf and dumb sister, dies after an unsuccessful attempt of abortion; Madhu had become pregnant after she was raped by some goon. Meanwhile, Jamuna performs the cleaning tasks in the house of Jahidul Islam, who is a divisional engineer of the railway. His wife Nilu likes Jamuna and allows her association, which Jahid does not approve of. But once when Nilu gets sick and is in need of blood, the sweeper, Hira, donates it after their blood groups match. Jahid does not like it, but it just so happens that the blood of a methor saves the life of a gentle woman.
The author has made the objective of her writing clear in the introduction to the book: ""This fiction was undertaken to reveal the dark picture of deprived lives who are treated as non-humans."" With her magnificent work, Kazi Labonno has depicted the lives of the marginalised and the insignificant with care and poignancy.

Bookshops serve more than just a place for bibliophiles to hang around, browse, and buy books. In the two recent novels I read, the bookshops featured are also hotbeds of budding romance, mystery, betrayal, heartbreak, political, and espionage intrigue. Louise Fein'sThe London Bookshop Affair(William Morrow, 2024) and Marjan Kamali'sThe Stationery Shop of Tehran(Gallery Books, 2019) took me time-travelling to two vastly different countries and continents troubled by wars and political upheavals. The backdrop of the former is the Cuban Missile Crisis, and that of the latter is the pro-Mossadegh and anti-Shah uprising. I was struck by the similarities and differences between these two books, especially when certain stereotypes about the cultural and social mores of the two countries were lodged in my brain.
The stationery shop in Tehran is prominently located across from a high school, and it stocks poetry volumes by the local favourites, Rumi and Saadi, and foreign literature translated to Persian to quench the thirst of the Iranian youth in the 1950s. The well-lit and quiet store is the gateway to modern Iran, where tomes of western literature are available to book lovers and help young men and women broaden their intellectual horizons. The London bookshop, H.J. Potts, is in the commercial part of Strand, a treasure trove of antiquarian books boasting the likes of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Mary Shelley, and Lord Byron; it hides between shops selling bespoke business suits and barristers' gowns and related items. It is a dark and brooding shop with stacks of books from the floor to the ceiling, smelling of ""dust, leather, and beeswax."" Incidentally, both the shops are the key distribution points of state secrets and forbidden literature. Mrs. Denton is the owner of the London bookshop, frequently visited by a string of secret service agents. Mr. Fakhri owns the stationery shop, where he hides pro-democratic and anti-Shah pamphlets.
A teenage girl occupies, respectively, the centre stage of both works—19-year-old Celia inThe London Bookshop Affairand 17-year-old Roya inThe Stationery Shop of Tehran. Although worlds apart, the main timeline in the stories is close to each other—London in the 1960s and Tehran in the 1950s. While Celia dreams of being a career woman and is trying to break away from her conservative working-class parents with rigid rules and outlook on life, Roya is in high school and her liberal parents, especially her father who is a government clerk, encourage her to choose a life of education and become a scientist. It's noteworthy how ""arguing back is frowned upon"" in Celia's household, whereas Roya has a friendly relationship with her parents where there is seldom room for disagreements.
Both Roya and Celia are strong characters with the ambition to stand on their feet; Roya is driven by an encouraging father and Celia by the lack of one. They are aware of the political environment in their respective countries and actively take part in bringing change. There are incidents of demonstrations against nuclear disarmament in London and student uprisings against the Shah in Tehran. Once again, we are reminded how youth take the lead in bringing about major changes in the political landscape. It was eerie that as I was readingThe Stationery Shop of Tehranon July 17, 2024, my own country was witnessing similarly strong upheavals by the university students demonstrating on the streets and looking death squarely in the eye.
For Celia, H.J. Potts is a place where she works and earns a bit of money. It's also a refuge from the constricting home where her middle-aged parents are always nagging her about marriage and how a woman should conduct herself. Besides, she loves reading and doesn't mind spending hours in the bookshop marvelling at the first-edition books before they are sent for auction. On top of that, Mrs. Denton gives Celia a raise, which she uses prudently to enrol in a secretarial course. Roya is as avid a reader as Celia, and her favourite place in the world is the stationery shop, where she gets her fill of poetry by Rumi and Saadi. She also loves to flip through the smooth pages in a notebook, the smell of the lead pencils, and the sight of fountain pens and inkwells.
The Stationery Shop of Tehranshows the family ties and bonding between the parents and the two teenage daughters. They love spending time together and the girls join their mother and their help in cooking elaborate Persian dishes full of rich and warm flavours and colours. The parents hardly have any arguments. In sharp contrast, Celia's meals are hurriedly put together with bacon-and-eggs or a steak-and-kidney pudding that her mother slaps on the table. Her parents hardly agree on anything and show no signs of affection. However, the reasons are later revealed through their backstory.
The depiction of London and Tehran helps the reader visualise the two cities and their culture. The drab and drizzling London with people wearing dark suits and carrying black umbrellas are in direct contrast to the flowery, sunlit Tehran. The thunderstorms and rains are palpable inThe London Bookshop Affairand lend a fitting landscape to the dark secrets Celia finds out about her mother. The budding love between Roya and Bahman is in perfect harmony with the scent of jasmine in the air and the trees and branches bursting with fresh green foliage in the Tehran summer. The descriptions of Nowruz or New Year in Iran portray a time of happiness, cooking, sharing, and exchanging gifts; people dress up in new clothes and visit their relatives. Persian dishes symbolise nostalgia, love, and bonding throughout the novel. Celia, on the other hand, has only her best friend, Daphne, and her childhood friend, Sam, besides her parents. She is conscious about her well-worn clothes and can hardly afford to buy new ones. She is discouraged from having any affairs of the heart and cannot imagine bringing a man home. Meanwhile, in 1950s Tehran, Roya and her sister are allowed to have mixed get-togethers at home with their college friends and cousins.
The stationery and the bookshop are where Celia and Roya meet their love interests. The bell at these shops announces the entrance of Bahman and Septimus. The door of the stationery shop brings in more than a gust of wind; it ushers Bahman into Roya's life, but unfortunately, she loses him also because of this place. The sound of such a bell in another stationery shop in another time and place finally finds Roya in a full circle, her questions answered, and her doubts quelled. Similarly, when the bell jangles at H.J. Potts and brings the suave Septimus into Celia's life, she is swept off her feet without having any idea of how closely he is related to the bookshop. Eventually, she loses him through unfortunate circumstances. These incidents help shape both Celia and Roya as they manage to put the past behind and make a life for themselves. Their resilience and strength of character help them soldier on through a life wrought with losses and secrets.
The London Bookshop AffairandThe Stationery Shop of Tehranare veritable time-travel portals. They offer a deep look at the political mishaps of the times, and as we witness similar incidents around the world, we can easily relate to them. We get a taste of the cultural and social norms of the two countries and how these can take a progressive or regressive turn. It is ironic how Roya's middle-class family is so liberal in the 1950s Tehran whereas Celia's is so conservative in the 1960s London. Furthermore, it was a pleasure travelling through the streets and squares of London and Tehran, being swayed by the tango of Roya and Bahman or bathed in the candlelight warmth while Celia and Septimus dined at an upscale French bistro in Mayfair. Both the novels put bookshops at the heart of their narratives, from where social, political, and romantic nodes grow and connect far-flung continents, cultures, and peoples.

Books are often staple travel companions. But as the reader leafs through its pages, they are blanketed by the warmth of its faint-yet-familiar scent, and submerged into a linguistic hinterland hiding infinite possibilities. As pages and letters metamorphose into a world unfettered by human limitations, books become much more than mere companions we literally travel with. Rather, they are transfigured into vehicles through which we embark on a more figurative journey—one of the intellect and the imagination.
In the classic modernist bildungsroman,The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man(1916) by James Joyce, the reader witnesses young Stephen's soul-searching journey of self-growth on the path to becoming an independent artist. The novel recounts a spiritual odyssey, autobiographical in its parallels with Joyce's own life. For instance, it ends as Stephen is about to begin his journey away from home, with the beautiful note ""O Life! I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race""—echoing Joyce's own relationship as an artist, with his Irish origin.
Traversing time, space, and continents, let us zoom in on ""When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine"" (1991), a short story by Jhumpa Lahiri that concerns itself with the tense concoction of American and Bengali culture.Traversing time, space, and continents, let us zoom in on ""When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine"" (1991), a short story by Jhumpa Lahiri that concerns itself with the tense concoction of American and Bengali culture. It is narrated by 10-year old Lilia, daughter of Indian immigrants to America. Although the whole story is physically set in their serene house in Boston, the turbulent Dhaka of 1971 and a Bangladesh in the throes of its birth are the central components of its setting. This is because the lives and habits of Lilia's family and their visitor, Mr. Pirzada, become dictated by the Liberation War, which they apprehensively view together through a television screen. Mr. Pirzada, a Muslim scholar in America with a family back home in Dhaka, is invited to dine with the Indian family. Without a television in his own dormitory, he routinely visits the Hindu household, ""bearing confections in his pocket and hopes of ascertaining the life or death of his family."" More so, Mr. Pirzada's visits to seek refuge appear representative of how the people of East Bengal travelled to India for refuge during the war.Read moreThe English-Bangla conundrum continuesThus, this story presents the home as a transnational space—a third space.

Traversing time, space, and continents, let us zoom in on ""When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine"" (1991), a short story by Jhumpa Lahiri that concerns itself with the tense concoction of American and Bengali culture.
Traversing time, space, and continents, let us zoom in on ""When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine"" (1991), a short story by Jhumpa Lahiri that concerns itself with the tense concoction of American and Bengali culture. It is narrated by 10-year old Lilia, daughter of Indian immigrants to America. Although the whole story is physically set in their serene house in Boston, the turbulent Dhaka of 1971 and a Bangladesh in the throes of its birth are the central components of its setting. This is because the lives and habits of Lilia's family and their visitor, Mr. Pirzada, become dictated by the Liberation War, which they apprehensively view together through a television screen. Mr. Pirzada, a Muslim scholar in America with a family back home in Dhaka, is invited to dine with the Indian family. Without a television in his own dormitory, he routinely visits the Hindu household, ""bearing confections in his pocket and hopes of ascertaining the life or death of his family."" More so, Mr. Pirzada's visits to seek refuge appear representative of how the people of East Bengal travelled to India for refuge during the war.
Thus, this story presents the home as a transnational space—a third space. A small house somewhere in Boston, America, is transmuted into a multi-cultural space that defies the divisive demarcation of the 1947 Partition of India which cracked the country into two and fomented communal violence. Yet, in the said third space, ""the three of them [Lilia's mother, father, and Mr. Pirzada] operat[ed] during that time [of Bangladesh's independence] as if they were a single person, sharing a single meal, a single body, a single silence, and a single fear."" On good days, they ate ""mincemeat kebabs with coriander chutney"" and, during the grave days of war, they observed an austere diet of nothing ""other than boiled eggs with rice."" Food becomes an integral literary device that depicts the waves of emotions sweeping through the lives of the inhabitants of this third space. In doing so, food constructs the multicultural or, in the words of scholar Homi Bhabha, the ""hybrid"" nature of the third space itself. The family's erratic changes in diet, attuned with the tumultuous political environment of a nation continents apart, reflect also the ""pregnant chaos"" characteristic of Bhabha's third space.

A curious tale of two cases

Nations remain in deadlock over a crucial pact on climate aid, with divisions over who pays, and how much, threatening chances of a deal being landed at next month's COP29 summit.
The UN conference starts just six days after the US election and the possible return of Donald Trump -- who pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement -- looms over the negotiations.
World leaders will attend a two-day gathering at the opening of the summit in Azerbaijan, which faces scrutiny as the latest petrostate with limited tolerance for dissent to host the preeminent annual climate talks.
Organisers say over 50,000 attendees are expected between November 11-22 in the capital Baku.
COP29 has been dubbed a ""finance COP"" because rich countries most responsible for global warming are supposed to commit to substantially increasing their assistance to poorer countries for climate action.
The current amount of $100 billion a year expires in 2025 and is considered well below what developing nations need.
But major donors, including the European Union and United States, have still not said how much they are willing to pay, resisting pressure to put even a ballpark figure on the table.
They are being urged to turn billions into trillions at COP29, but the appeal for vast new sums of government money comes at a time of political and economic uncertainty for many donors.
'Complex negotiations'
Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic between Russia and Iran with little experience in international diplomacy, has urged parties to make the most of the ""critical final stage"" before COP29.
On Wednesday, government ministers will gather in Baku to try and make headway.
""These are complex negotiations –- if they were easy, they would have been resolved already –- and ministers will succeed or fail together,"" said COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev, a former oil executive and Azerbaijan's ecology minister, in September.
""The eyes of the world are now upon them.""
Observers say climate leadership has been missing in action this year, with attention elsewhere even as fires, floods, heatwaves and drought have hit every corner of the globe.
As they stand, international efforts to reduce planet-heating greenhouse gases are insufficient to cap global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the safer limit of the Paris agreement.
""We are potentially headed towards 3C of global warming by 2100 if we carry on with the policies we have at the moment,"" Jim Skea, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told The Telegraph in October.
Developing nations suffer disproportionately from climate change and are seeking a deal at COP29 that ensures upwards of $1 trillion annually in ""climate finance"" -- 10 times current amounts.
They want the new agreement to cover not just money for low-carbon technology and adaptation measures like sea walls but for disaster recovery as well, something developed countries do not want to include.
Greenwashing
Countries obligated to pay -- a list of industrialised nations drawn up in 1992, and reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris agreement -- intend to keep doing so, but want wealthy emerging economies to help out.
This has been flatly rejected by developing nations, who say adding donors is not up for discussion.
""We should not let others turn away from their responsibility,"" said Evans Njewa of Malawi, who chairs the Least Developed Countries group of the 45 most climate vulnerable nations.
The spectre of Trump's return was one of the ""main issues"" clamming up the negotiations, said Michai Robertson, lead climate finance negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.
""You see a lot more hesitancy in general from those who typically contribute. I do think... they're waiting to see whether there will be a government that will hopefully stay within the Paris agreement,"" he said.
With the negotiations stalled, Azerbaijan has asked fossil fuel producers to raise $1 billion for climate action and has promised, as an economy wedded to oil and gas, to make the first donation.
Campaigners slammed this as greenwashing by a country expanding its own fossil fuel production, and whose strongman leader called Azerbaijan's gas ""a gift of the gods"".
Andreas Sieber, from activist group 350.org, said Azerbaijan's reluctance to address the phase-out of fossil fuels -- a pledge made at COP28 in oil-rich United Arab Emirates -- had ""become a worrisome pattern"".
Grim reality
COP29 is the biggest international event Azerbaijan has ever hosted, bringing unprecedented scrutiny to a tightly-controlled state that Human Rights Watch has described as ""repressive"".
Amnesty International and US senators have raised concerns about a crackdown in Azerbaijan in recent months, with critical voices jailed on dubious charges.
""The situation on the ground is quite grim... By the time Azerbaijan actually hosts COP29 there won't be much of civil society left,"" said independent Azerbaijani journalist Arzu Geybulla.
The summit has a much lower profile than the extravaganza in Dubai and it remains unclear how many world leaders will attend, with COP30 in Brazil next year considered of greater import.

Environment, Forest and Climate Change Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan yesterday said specific action plans are needed to make Dhaka liveable.
""It is urgent to have a city vision for Dhaka. Apart from implementing mega projects, green spaces should be increased. There should be open space, seating places and sports opportunities for the youth,"" she said  during a discussion at Rajuk Auditorium, on the occasion of World Habitat Day 2024.
She said Dhaka must be liveable for all, and youth involvement is essential in building a developed, environment-friendly city.
The adviser also highlighted the need for development plans that protect the rights of slum dwellers and those affected by riverbank erosion.
Adilur Rahman Khan, adviser to the Ministry of Housing and Public Works and the Ministry of Industry, attended the meeting as the chief guest.
United Nations Resident Coordinator Gwen Lewis, Additional Secretary Shakila Zerin Ahmed, and Joint Secretary Naila Ahmed also spoke at the event.

Flood victims in Mymensingh, Sherpur and Netrokona are suffering due to insufficient relief supplies and a lack of drinking water.
Flash floods have marooned 2,80,000 people in the three districts, according to data of the district administrations.
The flooding has impacted the agriculture and fishing sectors in those districts.
In Sherpur, two more flood-related fatalities were reported yesterday, raising the district's death toll to nine since Friday.
The overall flood situation in Netrakona's Purbadhala, Kalmakanda and Durgapur upazilas improved yesterday as water began to recede. However, the situation in Mymensingh remained unchanged.
Though the flood situation in Sherpur has improved since Sunday night, around 50,000 people still remain marooned in the district's five upazilas -- Sherpur Sadar, Jhenaigati, Sreebordi, Nalitabari and Nakla, according to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) officials.
Visiting some flood-hit areas in Mymensingh yesterday, The Daily Star found that people were suffering due to shortages of food and drinking water.
Flood victims said that they were yet to receive any food or relief from the government or other sources.
Hamidur Rahman, a member of Beeldora Union in Mymensingh's Haluaghat upazila, said nearly half of the 200 families in his union are facing scarcity of food and drinking water.
He said that some 250 people of the Barman community, who live on fishing, have been sitting idle at home since Friday as they cannot go out.
People from other communities are also facing food shortages as they are yet to get relief, said Hamidur.
Jatindra Barman, 50, a local resident, said that he depends on fishing to run his six-member family.
""I have run out of money as I could not fish in the last four days. I cannot buy food for my family,"" said Jatindra.
Narayan Barman and Subodh Barman, two other fishermen, echoed the words of Jatindra.
Md Humayun Kabir, chairman of the worst-hit Dakshin Maizpara Union in Dhobaura upazila, said about 80 percent low-income people in his union were suffering the most due to the flooding.
Only 80 families have so far received some relief materials, he said.
The district administration distributed 20 tonnes of rice and Tk 2 lakh among the flood victims in Haluaghat and Dhobaura upazilas on Sunday, said Azim Uddin, additional deputy commissioner (general) of Mymensingh.
Flood victims in Sherpur and Netrokona are also facing food and water crisis.
Maria Khatun, a resident of Balurghat area in Sherpur's Nalitabari upazila, said they received some dry food from volunteers over the last two days, but they did not get any government support.
Tarafdar Mahmudur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Sherpur, said that the district and upazila administrations are taking measures to control the flood situation.
Distribution of relief materials, including dry food, among the flood victims is going on, he added.
The Bhugai was flowing 75cm below the danger level at Sherpur's Nalitabari point at 9:00am yesterday, while the Chellakhali was flowing 77cm below the danger mark at Natkuchi point in the same upazila, said Md Nakibuzzaman Khan, executive engineer of BWDB in Sherpur.

Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association (Bela) served a notice to the Cox's Bazar South Forest Division to protect the reserve forest in the district from encroachers.
According to the notice, a total of 487 people grabbed around 352 acres of land under Mithachari mauza in the Panerchari range and around 290 acres of land under Reserve Teknaf Mauza in the Shilkhali range of Cox's Bazar.
The illegal occupants constructed houses, shops and other structures and are doing farming and other activities on those lands, it said.
Due to the grabbing of the forest land, an adverse effect has fallen on the forest, wildlife and the environment and the valuable forest trees are being lost and the wildlife is becoming homeless, the notice added.
According to the information, the Forest Department has prepared a list of existing encroachers in the said mouzas and sent eviction notices, according to the notice.
At the same time, BELA urged to find the real culprits involved in the destruction of the natural forest and bring them to book.
They also urged to revive the forest in its natural form by compensation and afforestation.

Two more died last night and today after being swept away byfloodwaters in Sherpur, raising the death toll to nine in the district in four days.
One of the deceased is Jim, 6, daughter of Jamal Mia of Chandernagar village of Sadar upazila, reports our local correspondent quoting Sanowar Hossain, officer-in-change of Nalitabari Police Station.
Police said the 6-year-old was playing in her grandfather's yard in Ghonapara village of Nalitabari upazila. Suddenly she slipped and fell into floodwaters and was found dead half an hour later.
The other victim is Abdur Razzak, 50, of Ghazaria village under Ganapaddi union in Nakla upazila, confirmed Habibur Rahman, officer-in-charge of Nakla Police Station.
The OC said Razzak drowned in flood water on Sunday night while crossing a canal to reach his house from the market.
Earlier, the bodies of seven other victims were recovered from different areas of the district on Friday and Saturday.
Though the flood situation has improved from last night and water began receding from flooded areas, at least 50,000 people are still marooned in five upazilas in Sherpur, said Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) officials.
Currently, Sherpur Sadar, Jhenaigati, Sreebordi, Nalitabari, and Nakla upazilas are still underwater.
The Bhugai was flowing 75cm below the danger level at Sherpur's Nalitabari at 9:00am today, while the Chellakhali was 77 cm below the danger level at Natkuchi in the same upazila, said Md Nakibuzzaman Khan, executive engineer of BWDB in Sherpur.
While visiting the flood-affected areas, our Jamalpur correspondent witnessed that flood-hit people with their livestock have taken shelter on high bridges and highlands in the upazilas. They were facing acute food, fodder, and safe drinking water crisis.
Many new areas, including houses, farmlands, ponds and roads have been flooded, said locals.
Sherpur District Relief and Rehabilitation Office Suchi Rani Saha said 14,000 packets of dry food have been distributed among flood victims and cooked food has been distributed among 8,000 people.
Deputy Commissioner Tarafdar Mahmudur Rahman said the district and upazila administrations are taking caution to control the flood situation.

Increasingly intense floods and droughts are a ""distress signal"" of what is to come as climate change makes the planet's water cycle ever more unpredictable, the United Nations said Monday.
Last year the world's rivers were their driest for more than 30 years, glaciers suffered their largest loss of mass in half a century and there were also a ""significant"" number of floods, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said in a report.
""Water is the canary in the coalmine of climate change,"" WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a statement accompanying the State of Global Water Resources Report.
""We receive distress signals in the form of increasingly extreme rainfall, floods and droughts which wreak a heavy toll on lives, ecosystems and economies,"" she said.
Saulo said the heating up of Earth's atmosphere had made the water cycle ""more erratic and unpredictable, and we are facing growing problems of either too much or too little water"".
Last year was the hottest on record. High temperatures and widespread dry conditions produced prolonged droughts.
There were also many floods around the world.
These extreme events were influenced in part by naturally-occurring climate conditions including the La Nina and El Nino weather phenomenon -- but also and increasingly by human-induced climate change.
""A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which is conducive to heavy rainfall. More rapid evaporation and drying of soils worsen drought conditions,"" Saulo said.
Massive glacier melt
Currently, 3.6 billion people have insufficient access to fresh water at least once a month per year, according to the UN.
This is forecast to rise to five billion by 2050.
For the past three years, more than 50 percent of river catchments have been drier than usual.
Rising temperatures meant glaciers melted at unprecedented rates, losing more than 600 gigatonnes of water, the worst in 50 years of observations, according to preliminary data for September 2022 to August 2023.
""Melting ice and glaciers threaten long-term water security for many millions of people. And yet we are not taking the necessary urgent action,"" Saulo said.
In addition to curbing the man-made greenhouse gas emissions that cause global heating, the UN wants the world's fresh water resources to be monitored better, so early warning systems can reduce the damage to the people and wildlife who rely on them to survive.
""We cannot manage what we do not measure,"" Saulo stressed.

The late August floods caused damage worth an estimated Tk 14,421.46 crore, and the government would need to increase its budget for relief distribution, according to a study of the Centre for Policy Dialogue.
The study highlighted that the damage was equivalent to 1.81 percent of the national budget and 0.26 percent of the projected GDP for FY25.
The findings were presented at a press briefing titled ""Recent Flood Damage and Rehabilitation Process in Eastern Region: CPD's Analysis"" at the think-tank's office in the capital yesterday.
The floods were caused by continuous heavy rains and onrush of water from upstream and affected 11 districts in the region.
The CPD's damage assessment focused on Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Feni, Khagrachhari, Cox's Bazar, Cumilla, Noakhali, Chattogram, Lakshmipur, and Brahmanbaria.
The CPD collected primary data through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, NGO representatives, and government officials. It also conducted field visits to Noakhali, Lakshmipur, and Feni.
The agriculture and forest sectors were the hardest hit. They suffered damage worth Tk 5,169.71 crore, or 35.85 percent of the total.
The loss to infrastructure was worth Tk 4,653.92 crore, 32.27 percent of the total. Damage worth Tk 2,407.31 crore, 16.69 percent of the total, were done to homes.
Noakhali accounted for 29.07 percent of the total damage, followed by Cumilla, 23.51 percent; Feni, 18.61 percent; and Chattogram, 11.63 percent.
During the recent floods, homes were badly affected, with many hovels were destroyed. The loss of crops and fish was huge, said Muntaseer Kamal, senior research fellow at the CPD, while presenting the findings.
The water bodies will require reinvestment before they can be used again. Poultry farms, particularly chicken farms, also suffered with entrepreneurs losing nearly all their investments.
Small businesses, especially grocery shops, faced severe challenges as they had to shut down, incurring heavy losses.
Electricity supply and internet access were disrupted.
Waterlogging persists in Noakhali and Lakshmipur, damaging roads, bridges, and culverts.
Educational institutions had their furniture and equipment on the ground floors destroyed, and children unable to go to school.
The study recommended social safety net allocations, particularly for elderly citizens, widows, and destitute women, be increased after careful assessment. Ensuring easy access to finance and providing debt relief were also highlighted.
The government needs to ensure that farmers can get agricultural loans easily. Small businesses, many of which have taken loans from microfinance organisations, may benefit from loan repayment moratoriums and extended repayment periods, the study said.
To protect the agricultural sector, it emphasised ensuring an adequate supply of seeds as the floods destroyed many seedbeds.
The study recommended immediate government preparations for rice imports and reductions in agricultural input import duties as the extensive damage to agriculture is also likely to affect food security.
Keeping inflation under control will be a significant challenge, it added.
The study also stressed the need for improving emergency response system.
Radio communication systems between administrative offices should be established for use when mobile networks are down, and ambulance boats must be available in flood-affected areas.
Effective coordination between various stakeholders, including the meteorological department and local government units, is vital for rapid emergency response, it said.
Enhancing the capacity of government relief offices by ensuring adequate personnel and training is also crucial, along with improving embankments and upgrading forecasting and early warning systems.
Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the CPD, said Bangladesh should prepare with the understanding that the country will face floods more frequently.
He said recent floods have been particularly devastating as they were prolonged.
The damage at the individual level are more severe than ever before, necessitating long-term credit support for recovery, he added.
Fahmida Khatun, executive director at the CPD, said the nature of the floods was somewhat different from previous ones. Areas that typically do not experience flooding were inundated.
""As a result, the affected people, as well as those involved in relief efforts, were unprepared,"" she said.

Three more people were confirmed to have died after being swept away by floodwaters in Sherpur district, raising the death toll to seven.
Sanowar Hossain, officer-in-charge of Nalitabari Police Station, confirmed the deaths to our local correspondent.
The three deceased were identified as Zahura Khatun, 70, of Poragaon union; Muktar Hossain, 50, of Urfa union under Nakla upazila; and Mahua Khatun of Namabatkuchi village under Nalitabari upazila. Mahua was missing since Friday night.
The flood marooned around 1.5 lakh people in Sadar, Jhenaigati, Nalitabari, Nakla and Sreebordi upazilas of the district, according to data of the district administration.
Aman paddies on around 25,000 hectares, and vegetables of around 1,000 hectares have been submerged due to the floods. More than 65,000 farmers have been affected by the flood, according to the local agriculture office.
Deputy Commissioner Torofdar Mahmudur Rahman said that operation for evacuating the flood-affected people and distribution of relief materials to the victims are ongoing.
Rapid rise in the water levels of the Bhogai and the Chellakhali rivers is leading to deterioration of the flood situation, Md Nakibuzzaman Khan, executive engineer of BWDB in Sherpur, said yesterday.
